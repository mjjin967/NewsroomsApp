But he began a recent debate with charm and bonhomie, encouraging everyone to vote in the European Union referendum Thursday, regardless of their views.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to encourage people to vote \u2018remain\u2019 on the 23rd, but if you vote \u2018leave,\u2019 fine\u201d said Izzard, speaking this month to a packed lecture at the University of Portsmouth.\nWearing a pink, French-style beret decorated with Union Jack and E.U. badges, he added with a wry smile: \u201cBut I would say to the \u2018leave\u2019 voters that the voting is on the 24th.\u201d\nThe generational divide is a major fault line in the E.U. referendum, with the young more pro-E.U. than their elderly counterparts. Campaigning on all sides has been temporarily suspended in the wake of the shooting of British lawmaker Jo Cox on Thursday. But as it resumes, campaigners will seek to energize their bases, with opinion polls showing that the contest is neck and neck.\nThis is a particular challenge for those rallying young voters, , including Izzard. (When asked by The Washington Post why millennials should listen to a 54-year-old comedian, he laughed: \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I do rather act in a young way. I\u2019m 22 in my head.\u201d)\nA recent\u00a0YouGov poll\u00a0found that those between 18 and 24 were the least likely age group to vote, with only 51 percent saying they were absolutely certain they would cast a ballot.\nYouth turnout has long been a problem in Britain, and there are fears that it could be exacerbated this year with the referendum date clashing with soccer\u2019s European Championship in France, as well as Glastonbury, a five-day music festival that attracts more than 170,000 people.\n\u201cEU ref vote being tactically dated around the same time as Glastonbury and the Euro Cup? This country is being run by snakes,\u201d a graphic design student tweeted.\nPolitical apathy has the potential to hurt the \u201cremain\u201d side the most, with polls showing that younger voters are the most pro-E.U. of any age group.\nPercy de Vries, a 20-year-old student campaigning with Students for Europe, said he was pro-E.U. because the bloc offers him the opportunity to work, travel and study in 28 countries. \u201cThat resonates quite well with a lot of students,\u201d he said.\nOlder people are less enthused about the European project. People 65 and older are the most likely to vote to leave the E.U., a position also known as Brexit, which claims that leaving would allow Britain to dramatically curb immigration.\nDavid Banks, organizer for Veterans for Britain, said that older people are more pro-Brexit partly because \u201cthey want their independence back,\u201d and partly because they have a longer experience of reading negative headlines about the E.U. from the British press, which is largely Euroskeptic.\nFor instance, when the E.U. received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012 for ushering in an era of peace and democracy on a previously war-torn continent, there was bemusement across Europe \u2014 but the British press was particularly critical. \u201cEU have got to be joking!\u201d was a headline in the Sun, Britain\u2019s best-selling newspaper.\nOlder people are also the most motivated to vote. In the YouGov poll, 81 percent of those 65 and older said they were certain to cast a ballot.\nThe Brexit supporters \u201ctend to hold stronger opinions,\u201d said Will Jennings, a politics professor at the University of Southampton. He added that unlike the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, where a turnout of 85 percent broke records, people were not as engaged with this referendum.\nBut there are several efforts underway to drive more people to the polls.\nBite the Ballot, a nonpartisan charity that encourages young people to vote, has joined Starbucks, Uber, Tinder and other businesses in an effort to boost turnout. In its partnership with Uber, a screen popped up urging users of the ride-hailing app to register while they waited for their car. Users of the dating app Tinder have been greeted with \u201cfact or fiction\u201d quizzes on Britain\u2019s relationship with the E.U.\nMichael Sani, the charity\u2019s founder, said it is more difficult to get young people to vote in Britain than in the United States \u201cbecause the U.S. fought for the freedom it has today, it almost wrestled for its flag and the Constitution, and you see kids in kindergartens reciting their forefathers. Here we don\u2019t have that, and I think because we never had to fight for it, it\u2019s taken for granted. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, but we need a solution.\u201d\nTom Harwood, a 19-year-old who chairs a group called Students for Britain, agreed that it is an uphill battle to get young people interested. \u201cThe overwhelming response from students is apathy. One, they don\u2019t feel they know enough, and two, they don\u2019t really care,\u201d he said.\nTo help strike up conversations on campuses, his supporters are handing out beer nuts and condoms with pro-Brexit slogans such as \u201cVote Leave: the safer choice.\u201d\nFor his part, Izzard, a self-described \u201cBritish European,\u201d said he wanted to make the positive case for Europe.\nDuring his speech at the university, he asked everyone to switch on their smartphones and search for photos of European cities.The students obliged, flicking through pictures of Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Prague.\n\u201cThis seems to gets lost in the argument .\u2009.\u2009. all of these amazing places you can go to on low-cost flights,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a beautiful continent. It\u2019s our continent, it is all of ours.\u201d"}, {"id": "7", "title": "Britain divided on eve of EU referendum", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/22/europe/britain-eu-referendum/index.html", "time_stamp": "2016:6:22 00:00:00", "content": "British politicians are making their crucial final pitches to a bitterly divided electorate Wednesday to persuade undecided voters of the merits of remaining in or leaving the European Union.\nOn the eve of the historic EU referendum Thursday, a decision that will shape the direction of country and its place in the world for decades, Britain is a nation divided.\nPolls have consistently shown voters -- a record 46.5 million of whom have registered -- split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call.\nThe leading political parties and newspapers are similarly divided on the so-called Brexit, or British exit, from the 28-member union -- an outcome that would be a huge blow to the European project.\nFrench President Francois Hollande warned Wednesday that it was more than Britain's future in the EU that hung in the balance, \"it is the future of the European Union.\"\n\"The departure of a country that is, geographically, historically, politically in the European Union would have extremely serious consequences,\" he said. \"It would also have extremely serious consequences for them, too.\"\nThe non-Brits guide to Brexit\nBritain's wavering voters are likely to be the deciders of this momentous vote.\nAnd with so much confusion generated throughout an acrimonious campaign -- and many of the fundamentals of the debate in dispute by opposing camps -- the outcome may come down to a question of gut instinct.\nWhy the Brexit vote is so close\n'Great Debate' yields few answers\nThe \"Leave\" and \"Remain\" camps attempted to appeal to those instincts as they squared off Tuesday night for a fiery, two-hour televised \"Great Debate,\" billed as the final centerpiece of the campaign.\nAmid a gladiatorial atmosphere before 6,000 in London's Wembley Stadium, six speakers representing the opposing camps clashed on such core issues as whether leaving the EU would help or hurt Britain's economy.\nLeading \"Leave\" campaigner Boris Johnson, a member of Parliament and former London mayor, described the EU as \"a job-destroying engine.\"\n\"You can see it all across southern Europe and you can see it alas in this country as well,\" he said, lambasting Brussels for imposing a \"multitude of regulations\" on British business.\nBrexit: Europeans hope Britain will stay, but they're not begging\nBy contrast, the \"Remain\" camp has argued that a vote to leave would do lasting harm to Britain's economy.\nThe debate focused on familiar themes of security, sovereignty and immigration, with Johnson's successor as London mayor, \"Remain\" advocate Sadiq Khan, accusing his opponents of \"scaremongering\" by raising the specter of Turkey joining the EU, potentially giving its citizens free movement within the union.\n\"Turkey is not set to join the EU,\" he said, holding up a pro-\"Leave\" leaflet that highlighted Turkey's proximity to war-torn Syria and Iraq. \"You're telling lies and you're scaring people.\"\nAllies -- from the United States to other members of the EU and NATO -- are all in favor of Britain remaining in the union, Khan said.\n\"In fact, all of them are saying we're safer together.\"\nSafer in or out of EU? Why security is key to Brexit vote\nIn turn, Johnson said it was the \"Remain\" camp that was guilty of drumming up fear, arguing that a Brexit offered \"hope.\"\n\"If we vote 'Leave,' we can take back our country,\" he said to raucous applause. \"This Thursday can be our country's independence day.\"\nThe \"Leave\" campaign has received more funding than its opponents, according to the latest figures from Britain's Electoral Commission.\nThey showed that the pro-Brexit camp received just under \u00c2\u00a315.6 million ($22.9 million) in donations, while \"Remain\" got \u00c2\u00a311.9 million ($17.5 million) from February 1 to June 9.\nBrexit: What will immigration look like if Britain leaves the EU?\nCameron's final push\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron, who has led the \"Remain\" campaign, did not appear in the debate but instead made a televised pitch to voters outside 10 Downing Street hours earlier Tuesday.\nHe appealed directly to voters of his and older generations \"to think about the hopes and dreams of your children and grandchildren\" as they cast their votes.\nHe said that belonging to the EU was good for Britain's economy, security and international standing, and warned that a Brexit would be irreversible.\nBrexit: What does it mean for the U.S.?\nCameron repeated his message during an appearance Wednesday in Bristol alongside former Prime Minister John Major and then later at a rally in Birmingham.\n\"If we want the bigger economy and more jobs, we're better if we do it together,\" Cameron said in Bristol.\n\"If we want to fight climate change, we're better if we do it together. If we want to win against the terrorists and keep our country safe, we're better if we do it together.\"\nMajor, Britain's Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, described the \"Leave\" camp as \"gravediggers\" of Britain's prosperity.\n\"If our nation does vote to leave tomorrow, we must respect their decision,\" he said.\n\"But if they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths, and misunderstandings, then pretty soon the gravediggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer -- they will have to account for what they have said and done.\"\nIn addition to the strategic implications of a Brexit for Britain, many observers predict it could trigger a political crisis, with Cameron struggling to remain in control of his ruling Conservative Party if he backed the losing side on such a critical issue.\nEarlier this year, Cameron negotiated with European leaders to secure improved terms of membership in the bloc if Britain were to remain.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned Wednesday that there could be no renegotiation.\n\"We have concluded the deal with the Prime Minister; he got the maximum he could receive, and we gave the maximum we could give so there will be no kind of renegotiation,\" he said.\n\"Out is out.\"\nWhy Brexit vote should worry Trump\nLawmaker reports death threat\nThe political climate leading up to the referendum has been unusually toxic, with both sides accusing the other of lying and making up their arguments.\nHow will nasty campaigns affect EU referendum?\nLast week, the country was shocked by the killing of Labour's Jo Cox, a pro-\"Remain\" advocate in her first term in Parliament, in her electorate in northern England. She was the first member of Parliament to be killed in office in 26 years.\nBrendan Cox, her widower, told the BBC on Tuesday that she had worried before her death about politics becoming \"too tribal and unthinking.\"\n\"She was very worried that the language was coarsening and people were driven to take more extreme positions,\" he said.\nJo Cox's bereaved husband: She worried politics becoming too extreme\nOn Wednesday, crowds gathered in London's Trafalgar Square to honor Cox on what would have been her 42nd birthday. Some waved signs reading #LoveLikeJo.\nNobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai told the crowd that \"the name Jo Cox will carry on the message of peace.\"\nDuring the event, an airplane trailing a \"Vote Leave\" banner flew overhead, irritating some of those attending.\n\"They missed the memo that we have #moreincommon,\" one Twitter user at the rally said.\nGoogle's UK homepage also contained a link in remembrance of Cox, which directed browsers to a post urging them to donate to her memorial fund.\nThe referendum campaign was suspended in the wake of her killing Thursday, and when activities resumed Sunday, many pundits predicted that politicians would attempt to strike a less divisive tone.\nBut ugly incidents have continued, with Labour politician and \"Remain\" advocate Yvette Cooper tweeting Wednesday that she had received a death threat to her and her family over her referendum campaigning.\nShe said she reported the threat, which came from a member of the public, to police and to Twitter.\n\"Time to stop the hatred,\" she wrote.\nWhatever the outcome of Thursday's vote, the consequences of this bruising campaign are likely to be felt for some time.\nIn a speech Wednesday, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, one of the highest-profile Brexit advocates, acknowledged the change in British politics the referendum had wrought.\n\"I have to say with some degree of pride, that without us this referendum would never, ever have happened. It is in many ways our referendum,\" he said."}, {"id": "66", "title": "Britons Split on Brexit, Think Vote Will Fail: Poll", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/poll-british-voters-split-brexit-think-eu-exit-vote-will-n594086", "time_stamp": "2016:6:17 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/poll-british-voters-split-brexit-think-eu-exit-vote-will-n594086\nBritish voters are deeply and evenly divided about whether to quit the European Union in next week's historic vote.\nClick to view image\nhttp://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2016_24/1581126/160616-brexit-vote-britain-referendum-729a_db30cde54e428928d5a7975203323f7f.jpg\nNIKLAS HALLE'N\nImage: A boat decorated with flags and banners from the 'Fishing for Leave' group\nA boat decorated with flags and banners from the 'Fishing for Leave' group that are campaigning for a 'leave' vote in the EU referendum sails by the British Houses of Parliament as part of a \"Brexit flotilla' on the river Thames in London on June 15, 2016.

Particularly in Berlin government circles, ''Europe'' is constantly invoked as a force for good (it has indeed been good to Germany), an idea that has brought peace and prosperity to a continent once ravaged by war.\nSo I thought it might be jarring to visit Bristol, my college town in my home country, which is contemplating leaving Europe in a June 23 vote that may turn on migration and other issues, but also on whether continental unity is a good idea. \n  At least, I thought, I might get answers to a current favorite question in Berlin: Will the Brits really leave the European Union, a possibility often referred to as Brexit?\n  Surprises lay in store in Bristol, an ancient port that was England's second-largest city from the 13th to the 19th centuries, played a big part in the slave trade and, according to the lively city history presented in a former cargo warehouse now known as the M Shed museum, has traded with Europe since at least 1180.\n  Pundits say the youth vote will be crucial in determining British membership; if the 18-to-30 crowd actually votes, the theory goes, the campaign to ''Remain'' in Europe will win. ''Leave'' supporters tend to be older and more fixed in their ways and are thought to be more likely to actually cast a ballot.\n  Based on an unscientific range of conversations over four days, young Britons seem to favor staying in the bloc. After all, they have never known a divided Europe, one without visa-free travel, cheap flights or jobs and the ability to study almost anywhere.\n  ''I think we'll stay,'' said David Knapp, 25, who works offering advice and support to Bristol students. ''Stick with what you know.''\n  Chester Hawkins, 18, a trainee carpenter, had never heard of Brexit. But his instinctive response was to stay. ''Strength in numbers,'' he said with very British common sense, so different from German idealism.\n  Nicholas Monk, a 26-year-old software engineer, was recently in Copenhagen and liked it so much that he was contemplating a job there. ''I like being part of something bigger'' than just Britain, he said.\n  But he and another engineer, Anthony Kennedy, 29, echoed all others -- including three female managers in their 40s who chorused that ''we're better off as an island'' -- in saying they did not feel well enough informed to make a considered choice.\n  In fact, no campaign posters adorn Bristol streets -- yet. The Remain camp called our daughter, Lucy, 23, to ask if she would be interested in canvassing as the vote nears.\n  But for now Bristol is more focused on its new mayor. While everyone was gazing at London and its first Muslim mayor, this cultural mishmash of a city elected as its mayor Marvin Rees, a 43-year-old native of Bristol, son of a Jamaican father and a white mother.\n  Like London's new Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, Mr. Rees is working class, and rose through the Labour Party. Once elected, he swiftly appeared in an interview with the BBC political journalist Andrew Neil. Exuding charm, Mr. Rees emphasized that he is one of the ''new people from a wider range of backgrounds taking up positions of influence.''\n  Simon Woolley, writing in The Guardian, noted ''the symbolism and enormous significance'' of Mr. Rees, ''the first directly elected city mayor in Europe of African or Caribbean heritage.''\n  Whatever the future holds, the rise of Mr. Rees and Mr. Khan represents the diversity that Britain can bring to Europe, where antimigrant sentiment is rising in many countries.\n  That sentiment can be found in Britain, too, where the Leave campaign has sought to exploit the view held in some quarters that foreigners are living off the welfare system. (''The only people I know doing that are English,'' said Mr. Knapp.)\n  But more than one million Europeans, many of them young, depend on Britain (and, to a great extent, Britain depends on them). Manuela Davanzo, 29, found no work in her native Brindisi, in southern Italy. Now, together with five other Italians, two Romanians and a woman each from Spain, England and Australia, she runs a gelato shop across from Mr. Rees's City Hall.\n  Life here, she said, ''is like our business -- going up day by day.''"}], "9": [{"id": "1", "title": "UK votes for Brexit: What just happened -- and what could be next?", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/24/europe/brexit-what-the-hell-happened/index.html", "time_stamp": "2016:6:24 00:00:00", "content": "London (CNN)As dawn broke over the UK Friday, Britons woke to the tremors of a political earthquake the likes of which most had never felt before.\nAfter one of the bitterest political campaigns in recent UK history, voters backed a British exit -- a \"Brexit\" -- from the European Union, turning their back on decades of peaceful cooperation with neighbors across the English Channel in favor of isolationism.\nRespected political commentators and regular Joes were quick to flag up the revolutionary mood as the country faced up to a stunned \"morning after\" that left many on social media, over breakfast tables and around office water coolers asking \"WTF?\"\n\"This is as close to a revolution as we've experienced in my lifetime.

However, the connections go well beyond direct trade between the two global powers.\nThe effect on America can come through a number of chain reactions -- a Brexit domino effect on the global economy. Here are four ways the wake of Brexit could hurt the U.S. economy\n1. Fears that the EU may be falling apart\nOne of the key global concerns rattling the markets is that Britain could be just the first of more EU countries to leave the union. On Friday, French right-wing leader Maine Le Pen called for France's own referendum vote. Concerns have been raised about referendums from Italy and the Netherlands too.\nThe European Union is one of the world's largest trading blocs and it's a major trade partner with China and the United States. If it breaks, it could lead to a lot of global uncertainty and many trade deals would need to be restructured.\nSome experts caution that fears of the EU falling apart are overblown. After all, the UK always used the pound as its currency. Other countries like France would have to ditch the euro and reintroduce their old currency. That's a much more difficult transition than what the UK must navigate now.\nPlus the high expectation of a looming recession in the UK may give other countries pause, especially if they see an economic storm that Britain may endure after Brexit.\nStill, the fear of the EU's opaque path ahead is real.\n\"We also need to acknowledge we are faced with lots of doubts about the direction of Europe ... not just in the U.K. but in other countries as well,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters.\n2. Volatile markets slow down the engine of U.S. growth\nAmerican consumers make up the majority of U.S. economic activity. If they don't spend, the economy doesn't grow. And how much they spend often depends on how they feel good about where the country is heading. Americans don't buy homes and cars if things look bleak and a stock market downturn can really whittle down confidence.\nBrexit is already causing severe volatility in global stock markets. If that volatility continues for weeks and months, it could cause American business owners and consumers to reconsider their spending plans.\n\"The keys to whether the U.S. economy is affected significantly will be whether equities tumble enough to have a major impact on business and consumer confidence,\" says Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a research firm.\nA cutback by consumers would be particularly bad news at the moment.\nU.S. job gains\u00a0have slowed this spring\u00a0and economic growth\u00a0was sluggish in the winter. But a recent pickup in consumer spending has been\u00a0one of the few bright spots. The added momentum in spending had raised hopes that growth would rise in spring and summer.\n3. Brexit triggers a strong dollar, which hurts U.S. trade\nA strong dollar sounds good -- and it is for American travelers -- but it's bad for U.S. businesses that sell products overseas.\nOn Friday morning, the U.S. dollar quickly rallied against the British pound, up 6.3% Friday, its biggest one-day gain since 1967, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.\nA strong dollar makes company's products more expensive -- and less attractive -- to buyers outside the U.S. That hurts sales for tech giants like\u00a0Apple\u00a0(AAPL), equipment makers like\u00a0Deere(DE)\u00a0and\u00a0Caterpillar\u00a0(CAT)\u00a0and global brands like\u00a0Coca-Cola\u00a0(KO)\u00a0and\u00a0Nike\u00a0(NKE).\nIt's one of the key reasons why Corporate America has been in an \"earnings recession,\" with profits declining for three straight quarter on an annual basis.\n\"The biggest impact economically is the dollar impact,\" says Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management. \"If the dollar surges on [Brexit] for any period of time, then you're going to see fears of the profits recession lasting longer.\"\nIn short, a stronger dollar typically lowers U.S. exports -- a theme we saw last year. The U.S. manufacturing sector, which relies heavily on trade, fell into a\u00a05-month recession\u00a0triggered by the strong dollar. Manufacturing lost a net 39,000 jobs in the past 12 months.\nSo if the dollar continues its post-Brexit gains, it would spell bad news for U.S. trade and manufacturing, which is just digging out of its hole from last year.\nA stronger dollar could make imported items cheaper for U.S. consumers, which could offset consumer fears about volatile global markets. But at this point, fears of a stronger dollar appear to be outweighing positives of it.\n4. Brexit forces the Fed to rewrite its rate hike playbook\nIn December, the Federal Reserve projected that it would raise rates four times this year -- a strong sign that the U.S. economy has recovered from the Great Recession. Higher interest rates benefit savers, who can make more money on deposits.\nBut by June, several Fed committee members were only calling for one rate hike in the wake of weak growth and slowing job gains.\nIf the volatility in markets from Brexit continues, and if U.S. consumers pare back spending, and employers slow down hiring even more, the Fed could be looking at zero rate hikes in 2016. In fact, markets are starting to increase their expectations for a rate cut this year.\nIt's not how the Federal Reserve had planned the year to unfold. U.S. central bank officials had started the year with high expectations after raising rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade, also known as \"liftoff.\"\nBut instead, the Fed is coming back down to earth. Other central banks around the world have lowered rates into negative territory and the conversation has shifted to whether the Fed should consider that move too.\n\"For the Federal Reserve, a Brexit vote would make it more difficult to raise interest rates,\" says PNC senior international economist Bill Adams."}, {"id": "3", "title": "How global markets are reacting to UK\u2019s Brexit vote", "publisher": "Financial Times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/50436fde-39bb-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7", "time_stamp": "2016:6:24 00:00:00", "content": "Michael Mackenzie and Eric Platt JUNE 25, 2016\nSterling had its biggest drop in the era of free-floating currencies, equities fell and gold jumped as Britain\u2019s historic decision to leave the EU reverberated across financial markets. Investors, who had been confident that the British public would choose to stay in the UK, also dumped bonds of the eurozone periphery countries and punished European banks shares as the future of the EU is questioned. US stocks dropped 3.6 per cent, led by banks and asset managers.\nSterling \nThe pound was at the sharp end of markets\u2019 reaction, with the currency at one point tumbling 11.1 per cent to $1.3229, its weakest level since the mid-1980s. Its decline comfortably eclipsed that of Black Wednesday in 1992, when the UK left the Exchange Rate Mechanism. By the close of trading in New York, sterling had bounced from its low to trade down 8 per cent at just under the $1.37 mark. Traders and investors will now watch to see whether it advances when markets reopen next week beyond the $1.40 level, a historic floor for the currency, or whether that will now represent a ceiling. The currency\u2019s weakness was widespread, with a 11 per cent decline versus the yen and a 5.8 per cent drop against the euro. \nEquities \nThe FTSE 100, London\u2019s index of blue-chip companies, crumbled almost 9 per cent at the open in London as investors took fright at the decision. However, by the end of the day the index, whose member companies generate about 70 per cent of their revenues outside the UK, had recovered much of its decline to close down 3.2 per cent. Banks, homebuilders and retailers were among the companies hit hardest, with Lloyds Banking Group falling just over 20 per cent. Investors\u2019 anxiety over the fallout for the UK economy showed up clearly in the FTSE 250, an index of mid-cap companies far more dependent on the UK for revenues. It finished down 7.2 per cent. European equities fared little better, with the Euro Stoxx 600, a major gauge of stocks across the continent, closing down 7 per cent. The S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent \u2014 its biggest one-day drop since August \u2014 leaving it below where it finished 2015. A sell-off on Wall Street was paced by declines in the financials and technology sectors, as investors shifted into haven assets. Banks and asset managers were among the hardest hit as traders priced in a far shallower pace of rate rises from the US central bank, a potential weight on profit margins. Utility stocks, generally considered less geared to the global economy with relatively stable cash flows and debt profiles, defied the wider drop to climb 0.1 per cent. In Asia, Japan\u2019s Topix closed 7.3 per cent lower and the Nikkei 225 fell 7.9 per cent. In Australia, the ASX index settled down 3.2 per cent. \nGold \nIt was a good day for gold investors, with the metal rising as much as 8.1 per cent before easing back to just over the $1,300-an-ounce mark, still up nearly 5 per cent on the day. Even before Brexit, gold has been one of the best performing financial assets of the year and is up 24 per cent for the year. Banks Asia provided an early taste of the pain for banks that subsequently spread to London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan. The Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC and those of Standard Chartered plunged 10 per cent at one stage. The worst punishment was reserved for European banks, already hurting because of negative interest rates, as the UK vote reignited questions about the future of the eurozone and wider EU. The Euro Stoxx Banks index plunged 18 per cent, its worst ever drop. UK banks were also hit hard, with Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group clocking double-digit declines.\nThe yen \nA haven currency in times of turmoil, the yen soared as much 6.7 per cent to \u00a599.02 at the worst of the fallout in currency markets. The scale of the rise, which eased to 3.7 per cent, raises the prospect that authorities in Tokyo may seek to intervene. Bonds Investors are piling into Treasuries, the anchor for the global financial system, with the yield on the 10-year note falling more than 30 basis points to 1.40 per cent, its lowest level since 2012. The yield \u2014 a benchmark for corporate borrowing costs in the US \u2014 eased back to 1.56 per cent in late afternoon trading on Wall Street. The 10-year UK Gilt yield fell to a record low of 1.02 per cent, a decline of 35bp, as investors expect easing and additional liquidity from the Bank of England. It slipped back to close at 1.08 per cent. The German 10-year Bund yield hit a record low of minus 0.18 per cent as peripheral yields rose sharply, led by a 35bp rise in Portugal\u2019s 10-year yield to 3.4 per cent. The Portuguese note finished at 3.31 per cent as the market calmed. Emerging markets With the prospect of a Brexit deepening risk aversion, emerging markets suffered as the US dollar rallied.

The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 3.6%. The losses dropped both stock measures back into negative territory for 2016. The\u00a0Nasdaq composite, which already had been in the red for the year, fell\u00a04.1%.\nThe drop erased roughly $800\u00a0billion in U.S. market value, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index.\nThe events in Britain startled investors who were counting on early polls as a reliable predictor, showing support to remain in the EU. During regular trading Thursday, investors sent the Dow 230 points higher and the Standard & Poor's 500 index to within 1% of a new record close, betting\u00a0that\u00a0a Brexit\u00a0would be off the table.\nEric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said\u00a0investors had \u00a0a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d that voters would reject a Brexit.\n\u201cWith last night\u2019s result, that\u2019s certainly unwinding,\u201d Wiegand said Friday. \u201cIt caught the consensus on the wrong side yet again. Complacency had crept back into the markets.\u201d\nThat made the impact from the unprecedented decision even more severe.\u00a0Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index dropped 7.9%\u00a0in volatile trading after the U.K. vote, closing below 15,000 for the first time in more than four months. That\u2019s the steepest drop in more than 16 years.\nIn Europe, London's\u00a0FTSE 100 fell\u00a012.5%, German DAX skidded 6.8%,\u00a0the broad Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 7% and\u00a0France's CAC 40 was off 8%.\nBob Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in an email,\u00a0\u201cFalling prices will unveil long-term buying opportunities, particularly for mid- and small-cap stocks\u201d not as exposed internationally.\n\"In the short term, markets will trade on emotion, so make sure you don\u2019t end up becoming your portfolio\u2019s worst enemy,\u201d he said, adding that investors should \u201cstay calm and carry on.\u201d\nThe British pound sterling dropped 10%\u00a0to a 31-year low, and the euro fell by 3.8%. The yen surged, briefly trading below 100 yen to the dollar for the first time since November 2013.\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, slid 5.0% to $47.62 a barrel, down $2.49. The global benchmark, Brent crude, was down 4.9% to $48.40\u00a0a barrel.\nAs investors looked for safe havens, gold rose 4.7% to more than\u00a0$1,322\u00a0an ounce.\n\"Look for gold to do well as part of the safe-haven trade in addition to the move into treasuries,\" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said in an email.\nThe Federal Reserve assured investors in a statement that it is \"monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation with other central banks\" and \"is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets.\"\nTo be sure, the sudden plunge in global markets, commodities and British currency may partially reflect the fact that investors had not adequately priced in the prospect of a Brexit. Uncertainty over the impact bedevils\u00a0investors.\n\"While we would argue that the British economy and its currency have not really lost 5 to\u00a010%\u00a0of its relative competitiveness overnight on a sustained basis, the level of uncertainty in the shorter term is definitely very problematic, and bets on any type of reversal do not sound like a good idea to us until the actual effects of last night\u2019s decision become more tangible and quantifiable,\" JBC Energy analysts said Friday morning in a note to investors.\nThe Bank of England\u00a0\u2014 the U.K.'s central bank\u00a0\u2014 said it was monitoring developments closely and \"has undertaken extensive contingency planning.\"\nEven as investors remained skittish, an undercurrent of belief that the market overreacted emerged in some camps.\n\"Investors overreacted,\" University of Michigan business professor Erik Gordon said Friday\u00a0in an email. \"Tough talk from Continental Europe and the effects on Britain will be tempered by the fact that continental companies still want to export to Britain's large, wealthy market and that politicians on the continent have to deal with their own Euro-skeptics.\"\nFitch Ratings declared the outcome\u00a0\"credit negative for most sectors in the U.K.,\" while S&P reiterated that it may lower the U.K.'s primary rating by more than one notch because the vote will \"deter investment in the economy,\" damage the sterling and undermine the financial sector.\nKyodo News reported that one Japanese Cabinet official said \u00a0a free-trade agreement between Japan and the EU \u2014 under negotiation since 2013 \u2014 would be difficult to reach this year as a result of the Brexit\u00a0vote.\u00a0The EU is one of Japan\u2019s largest trading partners.\nIn Scotland, where \"remain\" won in every polling authority, the\u00a0Scottish National Party\u00a0may well follow through on its threat to demand a new independence referendum, so Scotland can remain in the EU after the United Kingdom voted to leave. There is broad speculation that other nations in the bloc, emboldened by the U.K's decision,\u00a0will\u00a0move to leave.\nThe impact on the U.S. economy would be less direct, but U.S. companies basing their European operations in Britain could be affected, and both the dollar and U.S. stocks could be affected\u00a0by the turmoil in global financial markets. The\u00a0Federal Reserve \u00a0cited the impending Brexit vote as a reason to delay any further increase in U.S. interest rates.\n\"In a low-growth environment, uncertainty or increased concerns really do create tremendous volatility,\"\u00a0U.S. Bank Wealth Management's\u00a0Wiegand said.\nThough the U.K. won't officially exit the European Union for about two years,\u00a0Oxford Economics said it would probably take longer to renegotiate trade deals, meaning the country may be subject to World Trade Organization rules after its exit.\n\"One could argue that the U.K. will remain in the EU for a minimum of two years, as formal notice that triggers the two-year countdown to leave most likely won't be given for months, but the markets don't\u00a0wait,\" Axel Merk, president\u00a0of Merk Investments, said in an email. \"Instead, they are concerned about a disintegration of the EU, (and)\u00a0they are concerned about a waning influence of the U.S. over the EU.\"\nOne major British company, global energy\u00a0giant BP, said it respects the decision. BP CEO Bob Dudley\u00a0told the Economic Club of Washington\u00a0before the results Thursday that \"you\u2019ll see all kinds of dislocation\" and projected \"job losses in London.\"\nBP said in a statement Friday,\u00a0\"It is far too early to understand the detailed implications of this decision and uncertainty is never helpful for a business such as ours. However, we do not currently expect it to have a significant impact on BP\u2019s business or investments in the UK and Continental Europe, nor on the location of our HQ or our staff.\"\nOne specific effect of the\u00a0Brexit is a shakeup for the automotive industry.\u00a0LMC Automotive projected that U.K. auto sales would plunge by 15% to 2.55 million units in 2018, nearly half a million vehicles fewer than expected if the U.K. had remained in the European Union.\nThe U.K. imports about nine\u00a0of\u00a010 vehicles sold there, including eight\u00a0of 10 from European Union members. But eight of 10 cars made in the U.K. are exported.\nTaken together, the figures reflect the\u00a0interconnectedness of the British economy with the rest of Europe.\n\"Uncertainty will likely hold back investment\u00a0and hiring decisions\u00a0as businesses consider their options and wait for greater\u00a0clarity, something which is unlikely to come quickly,\" LMC Automotive said Friday in a research note."}, {"id": "197", "title": "How 'Brexit' Will Affect the Global Economy, Now and Later; Market Reaction", "publisher": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/upshot/how-brexit-will-affect-the-global-economy-now-and-later.html", "time_stamp": "2016:6:24 00:00:00", "content": "Things fall apart. And now, \"things\" includes the European Union.\nBritish voters delivered a well-aimed kick at the global elites who prefer a Britain that is deeply intertwined, economically and diplomatically, with Europe.\nSo now that they did it, what does it mean for the British economy and the rest of the world?\nWith the caveat that nothing is really clear in the immediate aftermath of a seismic event like the one that happened Thursday, here's how to think about the economic forces that have been unleashed and how we can expect them to play out in the weeks and months and years ahead.\nIn the short run . . .\nIf you run a British company that exports a lot to Europe, or manage a European bank with thousands of employees in London, nothing much changed with the results Thursday.\nBritain is a member of the European Union today, and will be one tomorrow. Your products can still be shipped to D\u00fcsseldorf without any hint of a tariff. Your employees can work legally whether their passport is from Sweden or Spain.\nThe immediate effects of \"Brexit\" will flow almost entirely through financial markets. Markets may be flawed, but they really do amount to a real-time verdict by millions of people with vast sums of money at stake on what something will be worth over the indefinite future. Economic shifts happen slowly; financial shifts happen overnight (literally, in this case).\nThe truth is that the stock market declines that took place worldwide Friday are nothing to be too concerned about. The British stock market, as measured by the FTSE 100 index, was down 3.2 percent late Friday afternoon in Britain, above its levels of mid-June. That suggests that investors do not envision the Brexit hit to hammer corporate profits in the near future.\nBut what is happening in the bond and currency markets suggests bigger problems are brewing. The 7.6 percent drop in the British pound against the dollar is indeed a seismic move - major currency pairs just don't do that. Since 2012, the average daily move in the pound-dollar exchange rate is 0.35 percent. This move is 21 times that.\nCombined with a rally in British government bonds (and consequently lower interest rates), the currency shift will mean a burst of inflation for British consumers as imported goods become sharply more expensive. It will also make the nation's export industries more competitive (for the moment, at least).\nIn the medium run. . .\nAs the months pass, the economic consequences of Brexit become less about financial market disruptions and more about real economic activity. Within Britain, a pall of uncertainty is likely to be cast over every business's decisions on whether to hire people or make capital investments - and that's true of both British-owned businesses and the many affiliates of global companies in Britain.\nIf you're an American company that has its European headquarters in London, do you keep calm and carry on? Or do you start checking out real estate in Frankfurt or Dublin or some other place where the relationship with the E.U. is more settled? If you run a British company thinking of building a new factory, do you start to entertain the same question?\nEven if the ultimate answer for these companies is \"remain,\" it is easy to see how the desire to wait for clarity could hold back economic activity for many months to come - and perhaps beyond British borders.\nAnd the decision comes at an uncomfortable time. The world's central banks, normally the first responders in times of economic distress, are poorly positioned to help. Those banks have signaled that they are ready to act, with statements from the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve promptly dispatched Friday morning.\nAnd it is looking as if the Fed is leaning toward easier money in the wake of Brexit. Futures markets priced in a 50 percent chance of a Fed interest rate hike Thursday, but that fell to 14 percent Friday after the news, along with a 12 percent chance of an interest-rate cut this year.\nBut both the Fed and the E.C.B. are already tilted toward cheap money - indeed, the E.C.B. already has negative interest rates. And the Bank of England faces an extraordinarily knotty situation. It simultaneously must plan for a possible recession caused by Brexit uncertainty and for higher inflation because of the drop in the currency and outflow of capital. It can fight one of those problems, but it can't fight both at once.\nSo a decline in business confidence and a rise in uncertainty, paired with limited responses by central banks, makes a recession a major risk in Britain and something of a risk in the rest of Europe and the United States.\nIn the long run . . .\nThings like business confidence, market swings and central bank responses shape the economy in the short and medium run, but over time it is bigger forces that prevail.\nAnd this is where there is the most uncertainty of all. What will a post-E.U. Britain really look like?\nThe exact process by which the nation will remove itself from the union is murky; it will presumably invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which is a mere 261 words. It isn't exactly a detailed road map for extricating a country from a complex set of interconnections affecting every facet of economic life. It will take years of arduous negotiations.\nOne possibility - the benign option, if you want Britain to remain well integrated with Europe - is to model itself on Norway or perhaps Switzerland, two countries that are not part of the E.U. but maintain free trade within the bloc.\nThe only problem with that: The price of maintaining free access to the rest of the European marketplace for those countries is allowing free migration from E.U. member states and accepting E.U. regulations on businesses. To the degree that pro-Brexit sentiment was driven by British opposition to immigration and regulation, this solution wouldn't really solve anything.\nBritain will get through the immediate financial turbulence and a possible recession just fine. The question for its future is which of two options British leaders now choose. They can maintain the status quo and remain a major international business center (while ignoring the impulse that led voters to choose \"leave\" in the first place). Or they can become a smaller, more isolated island that is a less important cog in the global economy - but at least one that honors its voters' wishes.\nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

The day of decision is just four months away.\nOnce the seat of a global empire on which, as it was said, the sun never set, the United Kingdom faces a stark choice: whether to continue to participate in the grand experiment called the European Union, or whether, in a sense, to pull up the drawbridge and stay home.\nDuring marathon meetings in Belgium this week, British Prime Minister David Cameron wrung concessions from the reluctant leaders of the EU's 27 other countries. His country will have special status in the EU. If it stay in the EU at all.\nBritain, it is now understood by all, will never commit to \"ever closer union,\" which has been the central goal of the EU and its predecessor organizations for decades. And it will not have to give child-tax credits or other financial aid to European Union citizens in financial distress for the first seven years, even when they come from other EU countries.\nSo Cameron has won his country special status within the European Union. Now he has called a referendum for Thursday, June 23, to give voters the chance the Labor Party long denied them -- to go the the voting booth and, should that be their desire, tell the EU to shove it.\nThe choice facing UK voters will be whether to have outsized global influence in situations such as those in Ukraine or Iran, by participating in a huge international organization, or whether or to go it alone, and retain a greater degree of sovereignty than participation an organization like the EU allows.\nCameron made it clear Saturday that he wanted Britain to remain in the European Union.\nCameron to campaign for UK to remain in EU\n\"Leaving Europe would threaten our economic and national security,\" he said. He pledged to campaign to persuade British voters to approve continued participation in the wake of his negotiations.\nAnd George Osborne, the country's chancellor of the Exchequer, or chief financial official, said that leaving the EU -- something he and the Prime Minister had recently been threatening to do, as they negotiated with other EU leaders -- would be \"a huge leap in the dark\" that carried grave risks.\nBut the deal and the referendum has split their Conservative Party, and some of Cameron's own appointees will campaign against him.\nThe most prominent Conservative opponent he will face over the coming weeks is Justice Secretary Michael Gove.\nGove said Saturday that Britain would be \"freer, fairer and better off outside the EU,\" the BBC reported\nHe said his decision to defy the Prime Minister was the most difficult of his career.\nBut he said, as quoted on the BBC, that the EU had \"proved a failure on so many fronts,\" and he felt compelled to put his political convictions before loyalty to Cameron..\nA Cabinet divided\nAt least four other members of the Cabinet are deserting the Prime Minister on the issue.\nCameron had promised in 2013 that he would renegotiate the terms of the UK's participation in the EU, then return to the British people to allow them the final say as to whether the UK should stay in the EU or withdraw from it.\nThe agreement in Brussels late Friday came only after two days of tense talks with other EU leaders.

Results show the Leave campaign has won with more than 51% of the vote.\n[Previous story, published at 1152 PM ET]\nThe United Kingdom stands on the precipice of a historic move to leave the European Union as a neck-and-neck race appears to have turned in favor of a \"leave\" vote.\nITV News, a CNN affiliate, and the BBC have called the referendum for \"Leave\" to win. CNN is not yet predicting the result of the once-in-a-generation vote, which could lead to the UK being the first country to leave the European bloc.\nAlmost 46.5 million people were registered to vote in Thursday's referendum.\nLeave.EU and UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who had earlier appeared to concede that the \"Remain\" vote has \"edged it, has said that he now believes his campaign would be victorious.\n\"I now dare to dream that the dawn is coming up on an independent United Kingdom,\" he told supporters.\nHistorian Simon Schama told CNN \"I think Leave is going to win this and I think Britain is going to leave the European Union, which obviously I think is a catastrophe.\n\"We're on a kind of very dangerous knife edge about the integrity and coherence of Europe. So one of those moments, if this result stays and Britain leaves the union, we're entering a very dark and exceptionally dangerous period in European and actually world history, too.\"\nThe final, nationwide result is expected to be announced Friday morning.\nIn one of the most divisive campaigns in recent memory, polls had consistently shown voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call, and wavering voters likely to determine the result.\nBut as results kept coming in overnight, the vote, with 274 of 382 electoral districts reporting, was 51.63% in favor of leaving the EU.\nPolls closed at 10 p.m. (5 p.m. ET). As results come in, they will be announced by region. The 12 regions include Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, London and eight English regions. Almost 46.5 million people were registered to take part in the historic vote.\nThe UK has been a member of the European Union (and its precursors) since 1973.\nMarkets start freaking out\nThe pound has dipped precipitously in forex markets as results from more and more election authorities come in, slowly solidifying the \"Leave\" camp's hold on the referendum.\nThe pound has dropped below 1.35 against the dollar, the lowest since 1985, according to Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale.\nEarly referendum results have sparked a global markets sell-off. London stock futures are trading 7% lower and stock futures in the U.S. are down 2%, CNNMoney reports.\nBefore the polls closed, markets had been expecting the UK would stay in the EU. But that expectation changed rapidly as results started coming in.\nThe pound is dropping sharply against all major currencies, and is currently trading at 1.38 against the dollar. Oil is down 4%.\nGold -- one asset investors turn to in the times of uncertainty --- is up 2%.\nTurnout appeared to be heavy, with pro-Leave margins surprising observers. Freddie Sayers, Editor-in-Chief and Chief Digital Officer at British pollster YouGov, told CNN that voters in areas expected to vote for Brexit are doing so in greater numbers than projected.\nLittlewood said the UK will have a difficult time moving forward, no matter what the outcome.\n\"Tomorrow we'll wake up to a totally divided nation,\" he said.\nHe predicted Scotland and London would vote to Remain and that Wales and the rest of the UK outside London would vote to Leave. The first districts reporting in London, as well as Liverpool, came out strongly in support of Remain.\nFull coverage of the UK referendum\nIn addition to the massive changes that a vote for a Brexit would entail for Britain, observers predict it could also trigger a political crisis, with \"Remain\" supporter Cameron struggling to control his ruling Conservative Party if he backed the losing side on such a critical issue.\nEighty-four pro-Brexit Conservative MPs have delivered a letter to the British Prime Minister's office saying that, whatever the result, they believe Cameron has \"both a mandate and a duty\" to continue in office, Conservative MP Robert Syms said on Twitter.\nThe letter was organized by Syms and signed by 84 Conservative MPs, two-thirds of whom publicly supported the Vote Leave Campaign, including former Mayor of London Boris Johnson.\nIll portents for 'remain' voters?\nBritons headed to polling stations beneath rainy skies in London, following torrential rains and thunderstorms overnight that caused flash flooding in parts of the capital and southeastern England.\nThe downpour wreaked havoc on transport networks in London and southern England and caused two polling stations in southwest London to close and relocate after they were inundated with floodwaters. Others across the capital opened late due to the weather.\nAmong the key political players casting their votes Thursday were UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who voted at a hall in London; Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who also voted in the capital; and Farage, who voted in Westerham, England.\nAfter the polls closed, Cameron tweeted: \"Thank you everyone who voted to keep Britain stronger, safer & better off in Europe - and thousands of @StrongerIn campaigners around the UK\"\nRegistered voters include Britons aged over 18 from England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar -- a British territory off the southern coast of Spain. Irish and Commonwealth citizens living in the UK are also eligible to vote.\nOne of the major groups wanting to leave the EU, Vote Leave, tweeted: \"Whatever the outcome, it's been an incredible campaign. Thank you to everyone who was a part of this! #ProjectHope\"\n'Serious consequences'\nTurnout in Scotland is 67% and voted overwhelmingly to stay in Europe. Should the UK as a whole determine to leave, many north of the border feel that this would be a catalyst for another Scottish referendum, allowing the country to secede from the UK.\n\"If this result holds, it's the end of Britain, just simple as that... Scotland is voting overwhelmingly to stay,\" Schama says.\n\"If Scotland cannot be coerced into leaving the EU against its will, you cannot, in all decency, deny them a second referendum. If all the leavers are about self-government, taking back control, why shouldn't the Scots take back control?\n\"Bye-bye Great Britain, bye-bye United Kingdom. That will absolutely happen.\"\nTurnout in the North East region was about 67% with 7 of its 12 districts reporting. The North East was generally Eurosceptic.\nBoth turnout figures are about the same as turnout for British general elections -- but the Scottish figure is significantly lower than the 85% who turned out to vote in Scotland's 2014 independence referendum.\n'Out is out'\nCameron negotiated with European leaders this year to secure improved terms of membership in the bloc if Britain stays in the EU.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned Wednesday there will be no further renegotiation.\n\"We have concluded the deal with the Prime Minister; he got the maximum he could receive, and we gave the maximum we could give so there will be no kind of renegotiation,\" he said.\n\"Out is out.\"\nFrench President Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Hollande also warned that the result would have a huge impact on the future of the European Union.\n\"The departure of a country that is, geographically, historically, politically in the European Union would have extremely serious consequences,\" he said.\nWhy Brexit vote should worry Trump\nToxic climate\nThe political climate leading up to the referendum was unusually volatile, with both sides accusing each other of lying and scaremongering.\nThe tension reached its peak with last week's killing of Labour MP Jo Cox, a pro-\"Remain\" advocate in her first term in parliament. She was the first sitting British lawmaker to be killed since 1990.\nHer husband, Brendan Cox, told the BBC she had been concerned about politics becoming \"too tribal and unthinking.\"\n\"She was very worried that the language was coarsening and people were driven to take more extreme positions,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, another Labour MP tweeted that she had received a death threat for her referendum campaigning.\nBrexit: What will immigration look like if Britain leaves the EU?"}, {"id": "160", "title": "EU Referendum On TV: Sky The Only Network To Air A Poll; Points To 'Remain' Win, 52% To 48%", "publisher": "Forbes", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilmidgley/2016/06/23/eu-referendum-on-tv-sky-the-only-network-to-publish-a-poll-predicting-remain-win-by-52-to-48/#38bec15b6f9f", "time_stamp": "2016:6:23 00:00:00", "content": "The only thing that Brits care about, when they tune in to election-night results TV, is how quickly they can get the results.

It surveyed people who previously participated in its online polling as to how they voted. The poll showed support for leave at 52%, to 48% for Leave.\n\"The results are close and it's too early to call it definitively,\" YouGov's Joe Twyman said in a\u00a0statement. \"But these results, along with the recent trends and historical precedent, suggest a Remain victory is the more likely outcome.\"\u00a0\nAs I write, just before 11:00 p.m. London time, Sky is still leading its \"ticker\" at the bottom of the screen with that poll. Neither the BBC nor\u00a0ITVis yet airing any polling \u2013 even though, on a general election night, ITV prides itself on getting constituency results quicker than any other channel.\nBritish broadcasters did not conduct exit polls of voters as they left polling stations, as is customarily done in parliamentary elections, over concerns that the margin of error would be too large given the extraordinary nature of the vote.\nIt's a brave bet for Sky to air the YouGov poll, especially given that\u00a0an internal UKIP poll is reported to show precisely the opposite result \u2013 52% Leave, 48% Remain.

(Well, she would be, wouldn't she?)\nSo far, Sky's coverage is by far the punchiest \u2013 not just in terms of those polls, but in terms of reporting the views of politicians such as Labour's Chuka Umunna, also softly-softly predicting a win for Remain.\nThe BBC coverage has its usual scale and ambition, with a massive election studio and huge projections \u2013 a bit like NBC's on Rockefeller Center \u2013 on the side of its HQ, Broadcasting House in central London. But its huge set, in primary red, yellow, blue and white, looks as if host David Dimbleby is reporting on\u00a0an explosion in a Lego factory. And its usual election-night ultra-cautiousness in reporting serves its position as the broadcaster of authority, but just isn't very exciting.\nITV's coverage is the thinnest, with poor Tom Bradby anchoring a discussion mainly with his own colleagues \u2013 although a recent appearance from the perfectly coiffed Andrea Leadsom MP, the Tory party's new star after her performance in the campaign for Leave, did buoy things a bit.\nNow, according to the BBC (at just before 11:00pm), Nigel Farage has \"un-conceded.\" It's going to be a long night."}, {"id": "193", "title": "NEW BREXIT POLL: Remain leads \u2014 but the race is just too close to call", "publisher": "Business Insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/survation-eu-referendum-poll-indicates-1-point-lead-for-remain-2016-6", "time_stamp": "2016:6:23 00:00:00", "content": "Two polls released on Tuesday show the Remain and Leave camps neck and neck in the EU referendum race with just 3 days to go until Britain votes on its EU membership.\nSurvation's latest phone poll has given Remain a slender lead of just one point \u2014 45% to Leave's 44% \u2014 just hours after a SurveyMonkey poll indicated a\u00a0one-point lead for the Leave campaign.\nAfter weeks of volatility across EU referendum surveys, public opinion appears to have stabilised with very little to choose between the rival campaigns going into June 23.\nBusiness Insider has annotated its live opinion polls chart to illustrate this.\nBusiness Insider / What Uk Thinks dataThe close nature of the contest ought to have figures on both sides of the debate very nervous ahead of Thursday's vote.\nA new ComRes survey is expected to be released today and a handful more will be published on the day of the referendum.

That process could take at least two years.\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK's departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron's likely successor.\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\"I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,\" he said. \"They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.\"\nFormer PM: There will be costs\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\"I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,\" Blair said. \"There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.\"\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\"Getting out of Europe is not the answer,\" he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. \"We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.\"\nPossible Scottish independence vote\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country's place in the UK.\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014.\n\"Democratically unacceptable,\" said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in.\nMORE: What does Brexit mean for you?\nSinn Fein calls for Irish unity\nThe Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nVoters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU.\nSinn F\u00c3\u00a9in President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules -- with barriers and custom posts -- between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK.\nAdams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement.\n\"My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,\" said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.\n\"We're calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that's been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.\"\n'Dying' institution\nAs European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the \"need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.\"\nShe said she greatly regretted the UK's decision, but added, \"The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.\"\nFrench President Francois Hollande called it a \"painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.\"\nItaly's finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.\n\"We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,\" he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website.\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side.\nHer party has suggested the French will also hold an \"out\" referendum if she assumes the presidency.\nPassions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a \"dying\" institution.\n\"We've given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,\" he told journalists. \"June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.\"\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK's relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain.\n\"I do think yesterday's vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK's relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,\" Obama said. \"That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.\"\nMORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum\nNATO: UK will stay a strong ally\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote.\n\"Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,\" said Stoltenberg. \"A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.\"\nVoters react\nThe referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote.\nNews of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate.\n\"This is so sad,\" said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. \"Millions of people aren't going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.\"\n\"People vote on emotion,\" Twitter user @cemanthe posted. \"This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.\"\n\"I am SO happy this morning,\" wrote another, Gemma.\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120,000 signatures within hours of being posted.\nLeading political figures gave mixed reactions.\nTony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result.\n\"It's going to be a complicated process but it's important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,\" he told CNN's Becky Anderson. \"It's still a resilient country and it's a strong country.\"\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of largely pro-EU London, said the decision was a \"clear message\" and urged calm.\n'Taking back control'\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was \"historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.\"\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential election, hailed the UK's decision to \"reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.\"\nIn a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters \"a great thing.\"\n\"They're angry over borders, they're angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,\" he said. \"They're angry about many, many things. They took back control of their country.\"\nUKIP's Farage told CNN's Nima Elbagir that the economic fears in the wake of the EU departure were overstated, and that he expected an even better relationship with the United States. He said the vote was a repudiation of bullying tactics by corporate and political powers to keep the UK in the EU.\n\"(We were) threatened by everybody that if we didn't stay part of this political union, dreadful things would happen to us, and what happened were the little people, the regular people, the ordinary people said, 'No, this is wrong,'\" Farage said.\n\"When you really think about it, what we've done isn't actually that radical. ... We want to be a democratic nation. We want to make our own laws in our own parliament, have our own supreme court, and control our own border. If you think about, there's now 183 countries around the world that have independence days. What we did yesterday was become 184th.\"\nOpinion: Why Brexit vote should worry Trump\nMarkets plunge\nThe effects of the vote outcome were immediately felt in markets and economies around the world.\nIn New York, the Dow ended the day down more than 611 points, to close at 17,399. London's FTSE index shed $164 billion of its value in the first 10 minutes of trading, but regained ground later in the day.\nThe NASDAQ index fell more than 4% and into a correction, or down 10% from recent highs.\nThe British pound at one point plunged more than 12% to below $1.34, its lowest level since 1985. Japan's Nikkei tanked 6.7% and Hong Kong's main index dropped 3.7%.\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said the body is \"well prepared\" and \"won't hesitate\" to take additional measures as markets adjust."}, {"id": "10", "title": "David Cameron's resignation speech in full", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/24/europe/david-cameron-full-resignation-speech/index.html", "time_stamp": "2016:6:24 00:00:00", "content": "British Prime Minister David Cameron has announced his resignation after voters in the UK's referendum backed a \"Brexit\" from the EU.\nThis is the full text of his speech outside 10 Downing Street:\n\"Good morning everyone. The country has just taken part in a giant democratic exercise, perhaps the biggest in our history.\n\"Over 33 million people from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar have all had their say.\n\"We should be proud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people for these big decisions.\n\"We not only have a parliamentary democracy, but on questions about the arrangements for how we've governed, there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves and that is what we have done.\nEconomy 'fundamentally strong'\n\"The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected.\n\"I want to thank everyone who took part in the campaign on my side of the argument, including all those who put aside party differences to speak in what they believe was the national interest and let me congratulate all those who took part in the Leave campaign for the spirited and passionate case that they made.\n\"The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered.\n\"It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organizations about the significance of this decision.\n\"So there can be no doubt about the result.\n\"Across the world people have been watching the choice that Britain has made.\n\"I would reassure those markets and investors that Britain's economy is fundamentally strong and I would also reassure Brits living in European countries and European citizens living here there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances.\n\"There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold.\nConfront decisions, don't duck them\n\"We must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union.\n\"This will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced.\n\"But above all this will require strong, determined and committed leadership.\n\"I'm very proud and very honored to have been Prime Minister of this country for six years.\n\"I believe we've made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history, with reforms to welfare and education, increasing people's life chances, building a bigger and stronger society, keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality, but above all restoring Britain's economic strength.\n\"And I'm grateful to everyone who's helped to make that happen.\n\"I have also always believed that we have to confront big decisions, not duck them.\n\"That is why we delivered the first coalition government in 70 years, to bring our economy back from the brink.\nFresh leadership needed\n\"It's why we delivered a fair, legal and decisive referendum in Scotland.\n\"And it's why I made the pledge to renegotiate Britain's position in the European Union and to hold the referendum on our membership and have carried those things out.]\n\"I fought this campaign in the only way I know how, which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel -- head, heart and soul.\n\"I held nothing back, I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone -- not the future of any single politician, including myself.\n\"But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.\n\"I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\n\"This is not a decision I've taken lightly but I do believe it's in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required.\n\"There is no need for a precise timetable today but in my view we should aim to have a new prime minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party conference in October.\n\"Delivering stability will be important and I will continue in post as Prime Minister with my Cabinet for the next three months.\nVoters' choice must be respected\n\"The Cabinet will meet on Monday, the Governor of the Bank of England is making a statement about the steps that the Bank and the Treasury are taking to reassure financial markets. We will also continue taking forward the important legislation that we set before Parliament in the Queen's Speech. And I've spoken to Her Majesty the Queen this morning to advise her of the steps that I'm taking.\n\"A negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new Prime Minister and I think it's right that this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU.\n\"I will attend the European Council next week to explain the decision the British people have taken and my own decision. The British people have made a choice - that not only needs to be respected, but those on the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.\n\"Britain is a special country. We have so many great advantages: a Parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate; a great trading nation, with our science and arts, our engineering and our creativity, respected the world over. And while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model for the multi-racial, multi-faith democracy, where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest that their talent allows.\n\"Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I've said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union, and indeed that we could find a way.

That number takes it well over the 100,000-signature threshold needed to force a debate on the issue by members of Parliament.\nA rush to sign the petition caused the website to crash temporarily due to the high volume of traffic Saturday.\nThe petition, set up by William Oliver Healey, states: \"We the undersigned call upon [the UK] Government to implement a rule that if the Remain or Leave vote is less than 60%, based on a turnout less than 75%, there should be another referendum.\"\nThursday's referendum had a turnout of 72% -- an increase over last year's general election turnout of 66%, but below the 75% suggested in the petition.\nThe \"Leave\" campaign won with 17,410,74 votes -- 52% -- to the \"Remain\" team's 16,141,241, or 48%.\nBen Howlett, a Conservative MP, confirmed on Twitter than the petition would be discussed by the House of Commons petitions Select Committee Tuesday.\nThat news came as some voters who had backed the \"Leave\" campaign took to Twitter to register their regret -- adopting the #Regrexit hashtag.\nOne voter, Adam from Manchester, told the BBC: \"My vote -- I didn't think was going to matter too much because I thought we were just going to remain.\n\"The David Cameron resignation has blown me away to be honest. I think the period of uncertainty we're going to have for the next few months has been magnified, so I'm quite worried.\"\nAnother \"Leave\" voter, Mandy, told the London Evening Standard that she would change her vote if she could.\n\"This morning the reality is actually hitting in and the regret is hitting in,\" she said Friday. \"I wish I had the opportunity to vote again, simply because I would do things differently.\"\nMeanwhile, Cornwall in southwest England -- a region which voted to leave the EU -- is now seeking confirmation from government ministers that it will keep getting funding equal to its previous EU allocation.\n\"Now that we know the UK will be leaving the EU we will be taking urgent steps to ensure that the UK Government protects Cornwall's position in any negotiations,\" said John Pollard, the leader of Cornwall Council."}, {"id": "13", "title": "Could the UK hold another Brexit vote?", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/27/europe/britain-brexit-inevitable/index.html", "time_stamp": "2016:6:27 00:00:00", "content": "The UK made a historic decision to leave the European Union on Thursday -- but has so far hesitated on pulling the trigger to go.\nNow questions are being asked as to whether it has to happen. Here are the scenarios in the conversation.\nUK Brexit vote: Get up to speed\nCan the referendum be ignored?\nThe referendum itself was advisory, rather than legally binding, and nothing was legally set in motion as a result of the vote.\nTheoretically, the government could ignore the result, although doing so would presumably prompt an angry reaction from the 52% of Brits who voted to leave.\n\"The referendum doesn't itself trigger Brexit,\" said Kenneth Armstrong, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge. \"It still requires the decision of a government.\"\nSpecifically, a Brexit requires the UK government to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU legislation governing a potential breakup.\nDuring the referendum campaign, Prime Minister David Cameron, who led the Remain campaign, repeatedly said that a Leave victory would automatically result in the triggering of Article 50. But in the wake of the shocking Leave victory, he has said he plans to resign in October and will leave it to his successor to invoke the article -- raising hopes among some that it might not happen.\nArmstrong said that while the chances of Article 50 not being triggered as a result of the referendum were \"very slim,\" the decision ultimately remains a political one.\n\"With the internal politics of the both the main political parties in such turmoil, it's so hard to know what the position of the UK government is going to be,\" he said.\nArmstrong said the vote was \"an instruction from the British people to withdraw from the European Union\" and as such, \"cannot be ignored.\"\nHowever, the longer the decision to invoke Article 50 is delayed, the more opportunity there is for politics to intervene, he said.\nFor his part, Cameron told the House of Commons on Monday that the referendum result \"must be accepted and the process of implementing the decision in the best possible way must now begin.\"\nHow Britons feel about Brexit\nWill there be a second referendum?\nMany disappointed Remain voters have focused their hopes on calls for another vote, with more than 3.5 million people signing an online petition calling for a do-over, and a Labour MP publicly calling for a second referendum to be held.\nThere is no legal obstacle to a second referendum being held, analysts say.\nHowever holding a second, divisive referendum simply because some people were not happy with the outcome is unlikely to prove a palatable solution, said Armstrong.\n\"I don't believe that this petition for a second referendum in and of itself can halt Brexit,\" he said.\nThere's one scenario under which the issue could be revisited at the ballot box: A general election could serve as a proxy second referendum on the issue.\n\"It would need to be a general election in 3-4 months' time that indicated a changed politics, and maybe then you'd be right to go back and check with the people that this is what we really wanted,\" said Armstrong.\nRacist abuse in UK reported since vote to leave EU\nWill there be a general election?\nBut Cameron's announcement of his intent to step aside does not automatically mean a general election will be held.\nIn 2007, Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair as Prime Minister after Blair's resignation, without a public vote.\nBut the current crisis engulfing British politics is uncharted territory, and with so much at stake at a critical juncture in UK history, a consensus might emerge that a general election was needed to give a mandate to the new leaders, said Armstrong.\nJohn Curtice, a political scientist at the University of Strathclyde, said a general election was most likely to occur as a result of the government of Cameron's eventual successor losing a vote of confidence.\nWhether any potential snap election becomes a proxy on the Brexit issue depends largely on how much the Labour Party is willing to make it one.\n\"Given how many Labour voters voted to leave, this may just be a wound that the Labour Party will not want to rub,\" said Curtice.\nCan Scotland or Northern Ireland block a Brexit?\nIn Scotland -- where 62% of voters cast a ballot to remain in the EU -- Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has suggested the devolved Scottish Parliament could attempt to veto a Brexit.\nShe also said Scotland could pursue a second referendum on leaving the United Kingdom in the event of a Brexit. Scots voted by 55.3% to stay in the UK at an earlier referendum in 2014.\nSimilarly, in Northern Ireland, where 56% of voters want to remain in the EU, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness has called for a poll on a united Ireland.\nCameron said Monday that Scotland's Parliament did not have the legal power to veto the referendum result, a position backed by Mark Elliott, professor of public law at the University of Cambridge.\nAs Elliott explains in a blog post, this is because the UK Parliament in Westminster is sovereign, and has not given away any of its powers to devolved legislatures like those in Scotland or Northern Ireland.\nBut Jo Murkens, an associate professor of law at the London School of Economics, argues that while Scotland and Northern Ireland may lack the legal power to veto a Brexit, the threat of the breakup of the UK presented a \"political and moral\" veto.\nIt is incumbent on Westminster MPs -- who were not just there to \"implement the view of the people,\" but to \"exercise political judgment\" -- to block the Brexit to prevent the fracturing of the kingdom, he told CNN.\n\"It's not 52 percent to 48 percent -- it's 2 to 2,\" said Murkens. \"Two nations have voted to remain and two nations have voted to leave. And if the overriding objective is to keep the United Kingdom together and intact, then MPs have a duty to read this referendum result differently and say in order to preserve the UK we will not leave the EU.\"\nPro-Remain MPs outnumber Leave backers in the House of Commons by about 3 to 1.\nArmstrong agreed that the sentiments in Scotland and Northern Ireland could play a major role in how Britain's political class navigates its way out of the crisis.\n\"Once that politics starts to play out a bit more, and it becomes clear that it's not just a case of the UK withdrawing from the European Union but the UK itself falling apart, that again may crystallize minds in terms of what the future looks like,\" he said.\nCan the EU push Britain out?\nAlthough European leaders have expressed frustration at the UK's failure to immediately invoke Article 50, they are effectively powerless to force Britain to do so."}, {"id": "72", "title": "Petition for Second EU Vote Hits 3 Million Signatures", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/brexit-redux-petition-second-eu-vote-hits-3-million-signatures-n599156", "time_stamp": "2016:6:26 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/brexit-redux-petition-second-eu-vote-hits-3-million-signatures-n599156\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union surpassed 3 million signatures.\nClick to view image\nhttp://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2016_25/1595476/160626-brexit-jsw-917a_123d759c7520203c3b1deb79c7a492fb.jpg\nODD ANDERSEN\nImage: Brexit"}, {"id": "74", "title": "Could Britain Reverse Its Historic Brexit Vote?", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/could-brexit-be-canceled-here-s-how-vote-could-be-n600451", "time_stamp": "2016:6:28 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/john-kerry-heads-to-brussels-and-london-to-manage-brexit-fallout-713954884002"}], "14": [{"id": "12", "title": "Brexit: EU leaders demand quick UK exit as economic fallout grows", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/25/europe/brexit-eu-leaders-meet/index.html", "time_stamp": "2016:6:25 00:00:00", "content": "Two days after UK voters decided they wanted to leave the European Union, foreign ministers from the EU's six founding countries met in Berlin to discuss the speed and strategy of Britain's exit.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said he'd like to get started on it \"immediately.\"\n\"Britons decided that they want to leave the European Union, so it doesn't make any sense to wait until October to try to negotiate the terms of their departure,\" Juncker said Friday, referring to British Prime Minister David Cameron's announcement that he would step down -- but not before a new leader could be installed in October.\nHowever, German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested there's no hurry.\n\"What's important is that Great Britain has not put into motion this proposal, and also the agreement isn't finished,\" she said Saturday.\n\"Great Britain continues to be a full member of the EU with all rights and responsibilities.

Schneider-Ammann, president of the Swiss Confederation, said that the Swiss-UK relationship needs to be reconfigured in light of the referendum results and noted that a working group formed a few weeks ago in case of a \"Leave\" win has stepped up its activity. Switzerland is not a member of the EU.\n\"The British decision raises many questions -- for the United Kingdom, for the EU and for Europe as a whole. And also for Switzerland. Switzerland will continue to take all the necessary steps to safeguard our country's interests,\" he said in a speech Friday.\nSwitzerland \"will continue to have a major interest in close relations with the United Kingdom, an important partner, not least in the economic area,\" Schneider-Ammann said. But economic ties and \"the free trade agreement in particular -- will have to be redefined.\"\n\"It is to be expected that today's decision in the United Kingdom will exacerbate the insecurity about Europe's economic development. This will also have a negative impact on Switzerland as a business location and will make it more difficult to find a solution with the EU on the migration question. \"\nSlovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said he respects \"the democratically expressed will of the British people,\" but also regrets the results of the vote. His remarks were in a news release issued Friday.\nCerar said he thinks that after a \"brief period of relative uncertainty on the international markets,\" the development will \"result in additional strengthening of the Union and incentives to carry out its reform that will allow us to face similar challenges more effectively, with a greater measure of solidarity and determination, and in a closer partnership.\"\nHe said Slovenia is \"strongly committed to further enhancement of the European Union. \"\n\"As its Member State, it does not expect that United Kingdom exiting the European Union will bring any major direct consequences for Slovenia. The long-term consequences of United Kingdom's decision, however, will depend on the newly agreed form of cooperation between the UK and EU,\" he said.\nHe said he expects Cameron will notify Slovenia and other nations about the UK decision to depart from the EU and that the exiting procedures will be started soon, \"pursuant to the Treaty of Lisbon.\"\nPetition passes 1 million\nMeanwhile, more than 2 million people have signed a petition on the UK Parliament's website demanding a second referendum on whether to leave the EU.\nAt one point, the website crashed after being unable to deal with the surge of traffic.\nBy law, all petitions to the site that receive more than 100,000 signatures must be considered for debate in Parliament.\nThe petition calls for a new rule to be implemented that would require another referendum on the EU question if the remain or leave vote is less than 60% based a turnout of less than 75%.\nMoody's downgrades UK credit outlook\nAmid the confusion and uncertainty, credit agency Moody's announced it had downgraded the United Kingdom's credit outlook to \"negative.\" It said the referendum result will lead to \"a prolonged period of uncertainty for the UK, with negative implications for the country's medium-term growth outlook.\"\nAnd this is just the beginning.\n\"During the several years in which the UK will have to renegotiate its trade relations with the EU, Moody's expects heightened uncertainty, diminished confidence,\" it said in a statement.\nRead: Why are the Brits thumbing their noses at Europe?\nCalm down, foreign minister says\nAhead of Saturday's EU meeting, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier struck a more cautious tone, stating it is crucial to preserve the \"project of freedom and stability.\"\n\"It is completely clear that we now have a situation that allows for neither hysteria nor paralysis,\" Steinmeier told reporters.\n\"We must not resort to hectic activity, and act as if all the answers are ready.

Fox had the backing of eight members of Parliament and was never considered a threat to trouble the frontrunners.\nFox said he was disappointed he didn't progress further in the contest, but he thanked his supporters and promised \"a statement about my intentions in due course.\"\n\"I felt it was vital to stress the importance of national security in this debate and the need for a clear path to our exit from the European Union. I hope I have achieved both these objectives,\" he said.\nHome Secretary Theresa May won the first round of voting in the bid to replace David Cameron, who announced he is stepping down following the Brexit decision, in which voters cast ballots in favor of leaving the European Union. Tuesday's votes were as follows:\n? Theresa May -- 165\n? Andrea Leadsom -- 66\n? Michael Gove -- 48\n? Stephen Crabb -- 34\n? Liam Fox --16\nWhoever is elected to lead the party will have to negotiate Britain's exit from the European Union and invoke that much-talked-about clause -- Article 50 -- which governs an EU departure.\nIt won't be Crabb. He withdrew his name from consideration later Tuesday and gave his support to May.\nHow the vote works\nWhen a prime minister resigns, he or she must be replaced. And that's a decision made among the party MPs and party members.\nMembers of Cameron's Conservative Party who are seeking to become prime minister need the backing of at least two MPs to officially run.\nWhen there are three or more candidates, MPs vote in an initial round -- which is what happened Tuesday -- and then keep holding rounds until the number is whittled down to two. A final vote goes out to the wider party, and the winner is Britain's new prime minister.\nThe result is expected to be announced September 9.\nThe contenders\nTheresa May is the big favorite with the bookmakers and leads the way with 131 backers within the Parliamentary party, but she's unlikely to have it all her own way.\nOne of the longest-serving home secretaries in British political history, she backed the Remain campaign, although rather quietly.\nMay has already said that no general election should take place before 2020, and she has been realistic about abandoning the target of eliminating Britain's budget deficit before the end of the decade.\nThe 59-year-old is seen as a reliable pair of hands by those in the party but has come in for criticism over her stance on whether EU migrants will be able to remain in Britain after a Brexit.\nWhile she has assured members of her party that she wants EU nationals to stay, she is refusing to make any promises before carrying out negotiations with the European Union.\nMay had also wanted the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, but has now dropped the idea with Parliament unlikely to support it.\nOne of the stars of the Brexit campaign, Andrea Leadsom, has come from nowhere to become a serious contender for the top job.\nA fierce advocate of leaving the EU, she has already said she would invoke Article 50 as soon as possible.\nIt marks quite a turnaround for Leadsom, 53, who warned it would be a \"disaster\" for the UK to leave the EU in a speech three years ago.\nShe defended that stance, saying that she had been on a \"journey\" since and had changed her mind.\nThe energy minister and a former banker, she has already been backed by 41 MPs, including Boris Johnson.\nLeadsom may lack experience in frontline politics, but as she pointed out: \"Our current prime minister hadn't been in government at all before he become leader and then prime minister.\"\nNone of the candidates have provided social media with as much comedy material as Michael Gove -- from the way he claps to the way he drinks a glass of water.\nNot that Gove helps himself. At his announcement, he said: \"Whatever charisma is, I don't have it. Whatever glamor may be, I don't think anyone could ever associate me with it.\"\nJust 26 MPs are backing Gove at this stage, with a large majority of the party still stunned by what they see as his betrayal of Johnson.\nGove, 48, the justice secretary, decided to withdraw his support after his \"heart told him\" he should put himself forward.\nHe was accused of Machiavellian tactics while one MP urged him to stand aside for the sake of party unity."}, {"id": "15", "title": "Brexit: Next UK prime minister will be a woman, as Gove knocked out of race", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/07/europe/brexit-britain-conservatives-vote/index.html", "time_stamp": "2016:7:7 00:00:00", "content": "Britain will be led by a woman prime minister through its complicated divorce with the European Union, after Conservative MPs voted the sole remaining male candidate out of the race to succeed David Cameron Thursday.\nThe contest to replace the outgoing Cameron as leader of the ruling Conservative Party -- and of the country -- will be fought between MPs Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom, after Michael Gove was eliminated in the second round of voting by their party's MPs.\nMay secured 199 votes, Leadsom 84, while Gove won just 46, Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative Private Members' Committee, announced.\nThe outcome means Britain is set to have its second female prime minister. Margaret Thatcher was the first, holding office from 1979 to 1990.\nMay: I will unite the party\nMay, Britain's home secretary since 2010, told journalists outside Parliament that she was \"delighted to have won so much support\" from colleagues.\n\"I've won votes from Conservative MPs from across the party -- from left to right, from leavers and remainers, MPs from the length and breadth of the country,\" she said.\n\"This vote shows that the Conservative Party can come together, and that under my leadership, it will.\"\nConceding defeat, Gove told reporters he was \"naturally disappointed,\" but said there was one \"important\" and \"welcome\" outcome of the vote.\n\"Whoever the next prime minister of this country will be, it will be a female prime minister, and a female prime minister who has formidable skills. And I know whichever one of the two wins, they will lead this country well.\"\nThe defeat is likely to be bitter for Gove, the education secretary, who, alongside fellow MP Boris Johnson was one of the leading campaigners for Britain to leave the EU.\nJohnson, the previous favorite to succeed Cameron, campaigned closely with Gove in favor of the Brexit before the latter unexpectedly announced he would not support Johnson in the race and was launching his own bid for the leadership instead.\nCameron steps aside\nThe race is on after Cameron announced his resignation following the June 23 EU referendum, having failed to convince the nation in his campaign that Britain would be better off staying in the union. He will step down in October.\nAn earlier vote between MPs of the ruling Conservative party on Tuesday saw two of five candidates out of the race -- one was eliminated, another pulled out.\nNow there are only two, with the 150,000 members of the Conservative Party set to choose between the remaining candidates, who will campaign for their votes over the summer.\nConservative Party officials have said that the winner will be announced by September 9, although there have been calls for the process to be sped up to help minimize the post-Brexit uncertainty.\nDue to the structure of Britain's parliamentary system, the winner will become prime minister, at least until another election is called.\nSo who is left?\nThe frontrunner\nMay, the favorite to succeed Cameron, has been described as \"a safe pair of hands\" to take the country through its negotiations with the European Union.\nCNN political contributor Robin Oakley said May, who had reputation as a serious-minded workaholic, was \"the nearest thing you could find in British politics today to Margaret Thatcher.\"\nOne of the longest-serving home secretaries in British history, May backed remaining in the European Union, though she is known to hold Euroskeptic views and didn't take a prominent role in the campaign.\nSome have asked how a Remain supporter could possibly be the best candidate to hammer out an exit deal, but May has responded by saying Britain is looking for more than \"a Brexit prime minister.\"\nMay, an MP since 1997, has already said that no general election should take place before 2020, and she has been realistic about abandoning the target of eliminating Britain's budget deficit before the end of the decade.\nVeteran Conservative politician Ken Clarke was caught on camera in the British media describing May as a \"bloody difficult woman,\" though he appeared not to actually oppose her candidacy.\nThe 59-year-old has come in for criticism over her stance on whether EU migrants will be able to remain in Britain after a Brexit. While she has assured members of her party that she wants EU nationals to stay, she is refusing to make any promises before carrying out negotiations with the European Union.\nMay had also wanted the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, but has now dropped the idea with Parliament unlikely to support it.\nThe bolter\nOne of the surprise stars of the Brexit campaign, Andrea Leadsom, has come from nowhere to become a serious contender for the top job.\nA fierce advocate of leaving the EU, the energy minister has already said she would quickly invoke Article 50, the action needed to officially begin the separation process from the European Union.\nIt marks quite a turnaround for Leadsom, 53, who warned it would be a \"disaster\" for the UK to leave the EU in a speech three years ago. She defended that stance, saying that she had been on a \"journey\" since and had changed her mind.\nLeadsom set out her post-Brexit vision ahead of the vote in a speech that lacked conviction but was peppered with a strong sense of patriotism.\n\"I truly believe we can be the greatest nation on Earth,\" she said, promising \"prosperity,\" not \"austerity.\"\nLeadsom entered Parliament in 2010 following a career in the financial sector. She has also faced questions over her resum\u00c3\u00a9, with critics claiming that it did not accurately reflect her professional experience in the financial world, according to CNN political contributor Oakley. Leadsom has rejected the criticisms.\nHer critics -- including her senior departmental colleague, Energy Secretary Amber Rudd -- say that because Leadsom's only been a minister for just over two years, she lacks the political experience for the top job.\nBut that hasn't stopped her amassing a team of passionate supporters within the party, some of whom marched on Parliament ahead of the vote Thursday to show their support.\nAnd, as Leadsom herself pointed out: \"Our current prime minister hadn't been in government at all before he become leader and then prime minister.\"\nAnd the loser:\nGove, one of the architects of Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union last month, was seen as the least likely of the candidates to survive the knockout vote Thursday.\nBorn and brought up in Scotland, he was a controversial education secretary, making radical reforms that earned him as many enemies as friends. He was eventually demoted by his good friend Prime Minister Cameron to chief whip, a position that requires keeping MPs in line with party policy and making sure they turn up to vote.\nThe 48-year-old politician's relationship with Cameron turned sour during the referendum campaign period, as Gove stood on the opposing side, backing a Brexit.\nNone of the candidates have provided social media with as much comedy material as Gove -- from the way he claps to the way he drinks a glass of water."}, {"id": "145", "title": "Race for Britain's Prime Minister Down to Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom", "publisher": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/world/europe/theresa-may-andrea-leadsom.html", "time_stamp": "2016:7:7 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON - One way or another, Britain will have its second female prime minister.\nThe governing Conservative Party took another step on Thursday in its process to replace Prime Minister David Cameron, winnowing the contest to two candidates: Theresa May, the home secretary, and Andrea Leadsom, the junior energy minister.\nWhen the contest is concluded in September, one of them will become the first woman to lead Britain since Margaret Thatcher, also a Conservative, stepped down in 1990. The winner will take over as Britain grapples with how to carry through with its stunning decision last month       \u00a0    to withdraw from the European Union, a choice that Mr. Cameron opposed and that led him to announce he would step aside once the party chose a successor.\nMs. May quietly supported remaining in the European Union but has since said that she respects the outcome of the June 23 referendum and that she will seek the best possible deal for Britain as it negotiates its withdrawal from the bloc. She dominated the first stage of the selection process, in which the field is narrowed to two candidates through voting by the 330 Conservative members of the House of Commons.\nMs. May, 59, remains the favorite, but in the next round will be judged by a different constituency: registered party members, many of whom were vociferous supporters of leaving the European Union. Conservative Party headquarters has for days been unable or unwilling to disclose how many registered voters there are, but the House of Commons Library said that the latest published figure of 149,800 stems from December 2013. Voters will mail in their ballots, with the winner, to be announced on Sept. 9, becoming party leader and prime minister without having to call a general election.\nMs. Leadsom, 53, the runner-up in Thursday's round of voting by members of Parliament, was a vocal advocate of leaving the European Union. In finishing second and qualifying for the final round, she eliminated Michael Gove, the justice secretary, who helped lead the Leave campaign. Mr. Gove had announced his candidacy just before the deadline last week, and in doing so       \u00a0    torpedoed the hopes of his partner in the Leave campaign, Boris Johnson, the former London mayor, to succeed Mr. Cameron.\nMs. May holds one of the highest-profile posts in the British government and is considered the more experienced candidate - serious and competent but lacking charisma. Ms. Leadsom, who had a low profile and entered government as a junior minister only in 2014, has been accused of inflating her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. As recently as three years ago, she supported continued British membership in the European Union.\nMs. Leadsom put her 25 years of working in financial services before becoming a legislator in 2010 at the center of her leadership campaign, but those who worked with her have told reporters that she exaggerated her role at Barclays Bank and Invesco Perpetual, a fund manager. She told Sky News, \"My CV is correct.\"\nIn Thursday's voting, Ms. May received 199 votes, Ms. Leadsom 84 and Mr. Gove 46.\nMs. May and Ms. Leadsom are both ideological conservatives whose backgrounds are far different from those of the Eton-Oxford male circle that has dominated Conservative politics since Mr. Cameron became party leader in 2005. Both women went to state schools, where Ms. May won a place at Oxford. Ms. Leadsom went to the University of Warwick.\nMs. May said on Twitter that she was gratified by support from across the Conservative Party, including both people who favored membership in the European Union and those against it. \"I've always said there should be a proper contest. Now is the time for me and my team to take our case out to members in the country,\" she wrote. \"We need proven leadership to negotiate the best deal as we leave the E.U., unite our party, and build a country that works for everyone.\"\nIn a speech on Thursday, Ms. Leadsom said she would focus on \"the continued success of the U.K. economy,\" which has been hit hard by Brexit, raising fears of an increased budget deficit from lower growth and lower tax receipts. \"Prosperity should be our goal, not austerity,\" she said.\nShe also said that \"trade must be our top priority: continued free trade with the E.U.\" She added that she favored \"fair but controlled immigration,\" without explaining how duty-free trade with the European Union could be maintained while scrapping European rules on freedom of movement and labor, which she also has said she intends to do.\nEuropean Union leaders have repeatedly said that access to the single market of the European Union is not possible without accepting freedom of movement and labor.\nMs. Leadsom had initially agreed to back Mr. Johnson in return for the promise of a high government post. He was supposed to call or text her confirming their arrangement by a certain time, but failed to do so, prompting Ms. Leadsom to announce her own surprise candidacy.\nSimon Jenkins, writing in The Guardian, defended Brexit as the instrument of a great clearing out of a stagnant British politics. \"It has got rid of a prime minister and is about to get rid of a leader of the opposition,\" he wrote. \"It will soon be rid of a chancellor of the Exchequer and a lord chancellor. It is also rid of two, if not four, Tory heirs apparent.\"\nEven more, Mr. Jenkins said, the Labour Party is in chaos and the Greens and the U.K. Independence Party have both lost their leaders. \"An entire political class is on the way out.

She is ideally placed to implement Brexit and has promised to do so. I have concluded that the interests of our country are best served by the implementation of a strong leader,\" Leadsom said.\n\"I am therefore withdrawing from the leadership election,\" she said, adding that she gave May her \"full support.\"\nLeadsom's withdrawal from the race came in the face of pressure from a faction of lawmakers in the warring Conservative Party.\nThe energy minister has drawn fierce criticism in the past week, accused of exaggerating her professional experience and asserting she could run the country better than May because she is a mother.\nDaunting job\nThe new prime minister faces the daunting job of negotiating a deal with an angered EU, one that does not cripple the British economy and keeps the country on friendly terms with neighbors.\nMay, often described as \"a safe pair of hands\" to take the UK through its negotiations, made a speech Monday that she would follow through with the withdrawal from the EU.\nWill the next British prime minister have the job from hell?\nCNN's Oakley said May, who had a reputation as a serious-minded workaholic, was \"the nearest thing you could find in British politics today to Margaret Thatcher.\"\nOne of the longest-serving home secretaries in British history, May backed remaining in the EU, though she is known to hold Euroskeptic views and didn't take a prominent role in the campaign.\nLeadsom was a strong advocate of leaving the EU, marking quite a turnaround for the politician, who three years ago said it would be a \"disaster\" for the UK to leave the union.\nShe defended that stance, saying that she had been on a \"journey\" since and had changed her mind.\nLeadsom set out her post-Brexit vision ahead of the vote in a speech peppered with a strong sense of patriotism."}, {"id": "18", "title": "Theresa May becomes new British Prime Minister", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/13/europe/theresa-may-david-cameron-british-prime-minister/index.html", "time_stamp": "2016:7:13 00:00:00", "content": "Theresa May struck a populist tone in her first public remarks as British Prime Minister on Wednesday, saying she planned to continue predecessor David Cameron's \"true legacy\" of social justice.\nThe Conservative Party leader spoke directly to the poor, black and white working-class residents as well as women, youth and those with mental health issues, saying, \"The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of a privileged few, but by yours.\"\nHer party prizes unionism, she said, and not just among England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, \"but between all of our citizens, everyone, whoever we are and wherever we're from.\"\n\"David Cameron has led a one-nation government, and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead,\" she said.\nMay wasted no time getting to work, naming six Cabinet members shortly after taking the nation's helm. Among them were two of her chief rivals in her bid to head the Conservative Party: members of Parliament Boris Johnson and Liam Fox.\nWho is Theresa May?\nIn his final appearance in Parliament as Prime Minister, Cameron opened with the quip that \"apart from one meeting in the afternoon with the Queen, my diary is remarkably light.\"\nBefore resigning, Cameron delivered remarks outside 10 Downing Street, saying, \"It's not been an easy journey, and of course we've not got every decision right, but I do believe that today our country is much stronger.\"\nHe wished May the best, especially as she negotiates the country's \"Brexit\" from the European Union. If he were granted one wish, he said, it would be the \"continued success of this great country that I love so very much.\" Cameron will continue on as a member of Parliament.\nLive updates: Theresa May takes reins\nLeaving on light note\nEarlier Wednesday, Cameron appeared to be in a jovial mood as he told members of Parliament: \"I have addressed 5,500 questions from this dispatch box -- I'll leave it to others to decide how many I've answered.\"\nHe held up a photo of himself with Larry the Downing Street cat, saying he loved the \"chief mouser\" and was sad to be leaving him behind.\nOn a more serious note, Cameron said he cared passionately about the UK, adding that \"we need to make sure as we leave the EU, how we keep the benefits of the common travel area.\"\nGesturing across the room and up to his wife, Samantha, watching from the gallery, he said: \"I will miss the roar of the crowd, I will miss the barbs from the opposition, but I will be willing you on.\n\"Nothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it. After all, as I once said, I was the future once.\"\nHow did we get here?\nCameron announced his resignation last month, following the UK's shock referendum vote to leave the EU.\nMay -- who became Conservative leader Monday after her sole contender for the job, Andrea Leadsom, dropped out of the race -- is Britain's second female prime minister after Margaret Thatcher, who held office from 1979 to 1990.\nThe past few weeks have been dramatic ones in British politics, with Brexit setting off a domino effect of politicians falling by the wayside -- Cameron resigned, allies stabbed likely successor Boris Johnson \"in the back,\" and leadership contender Leadsom threw in the towel amid controversial comments on motherhood.\nMay has a daunting job as prime minister, facing pressure to start Brexit negotiations with the EU, salvage a plummeting economy and unite a divided nation.\nA hefty to-do list: What awaits Britain's next PM\nWhat lies ahead for May?\nMay will need to form a Cabinet -- speculated to include many female ministers and a designated Brexit minister.\nWill the next PM have the job from hell?\nShe took the first steps in that process shortly after assuming the mantle. She named ex-Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond the chancellor of the Exchequer, a position that oversees the British Treasury, according to a statement from 10 Downing Street.\nLater, she tapped Johnson as foreign secretary and Fox as secretary of state for international trade. Both members of Parliament unsuccessfully challenged her for Conservative Party leadership, and Johnson, the former London mayor, was one of the leaders of the campaign to leave the EU.\nOther appointments: Amber Rudd, former secretary of state for energy and climate change, was named home secretary, the position May vacated to become Prime Minister; Michael Fallon will remain as defense secretary; and David Davis was selected as the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, 10 Downing Street said.\nThe latter post is a newly created one also known as the Brexit secretary. Davis backed the campaign to leave the European Union.\nFox marked the last of Wednesday's appointments, May's office said.\nShe is expected to meet Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in the coming days, with Sturgeon telling a news conference Wednesday that Brexit \"does not apply to Scotland, as Scotland voted differently in the referendum.\"\nScotland bucked the national trend for the referendum, with 62% voting to remain.\nSturgeon offered her congratulations to May, expressing hope that \"despite our differences,\" they can have a constructive working relationship.\nScotland likely to seek independence after EU vote\nAlong with overseeing EU negotiations, May will need to unite a nation deeply divided over the referendum where 52% voted to leave and 48% to remain.\nNot to mention a Conservative Party whose infighting over Europe prompted Cameron to call a referendum in the first place -- leading to his spectacular downfall.\nCongratulations pour in\nAmong those congratulating May were European leaders with whom she will work closely during Brexit talks.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Holland spoke with May on the phone.\n\"They pledged to actively pursue the development of the bilateral friendly relationship between France and the United Kingdom in all areas,\" Hollande's office said. \"The President reiterated his hope that negotiations for the exit of United Kingdom from the European Union are started as soon as possible.\"\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, who campaigned against Brexit, congratulated May and urged her to address aspects of Britain's post-EU future such as the capital's economy and status of EU citizens in Britain.\nCongratulations also came from European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker."}, {"id": "76", "title": "This 'Bloody Difficult Woman' Is U.K.'s New Leader", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/theresa-may-bloody-difficult-woman-be-u-k-prime-minister-n608001", "time_stamp": "2016:7:13 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/theresa-may-bloody-difficult-woman-be-u-k-prime-minister-n608001\nAs Theresa May becomes Britain's new prime minister, what is in store for relations between Washington and London?\nClick to view image\nhttp://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2016_28/1617766/160713-theresa-may-downing-street-726a_8589eb99852276f228c20526fbae2816.jpg\nKirsty Wigglesworth\nImage: Britain's Home Secretary Theresa May\nBritain's Home Secretary Theresa May leaves after attending a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street, in London, Tuesday, July 12, 2016.

But that future now belongs to May, and it involves instability, uncertainty and tough wrangling over Britain's departure from the European Union.\nBritain's transition of power unfolded with startling speed since the June 23 referendum on EU membership. Cameron announced his resignation after voters rejected his appeal to stay in the 28-nation bloc, and May, the former home secretary, became Conservative Party leader Monday after an abbreviated contest in which her only remaining rival dropped out.\nThen came Wednesday's ceremonial choreography: Two trips to Buckingham Palace and two audiences with Queen Elizabeth II that ended with one prime minister out of a job and a new one curtseying to the monarch to begin her term.\nMay stood in front of the iconic door of No. 10 with her husband, Philip, as the 13th prime minister of the queen's reign and the first woman to hold the job since fellow Conservative Margaret Thatcher served from 1979 to 1990.\nShe acknowledged that Britain faces a rocky road ahead as it undoes 43 years of EU ties and forges a new relationship with its neighbors.\n\"Following the referendum, we face a time of great national change,\" May said. \"And I know because we're Great Britain we will rise to the challenge.\n\"As we leave the European Union we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us,\" she said.\nMay promised to fight for social justice in a speech that addressed \"hard-working families\" who have struggled during the years of instability since the 2008 financial crisis. Many of those people, fed up with remote politicians and bureaucrats, voted to leave the EU.\n\"When it comes to opportunity we won't entrench the advantages of the fortunate few. We will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you,\" May said, in language more often used by left-of-center politicians, rather than by members of the center-right Conservative Party.\nMay began appointing her new Cabinet within an hour of taking office, and several posts went to \"leave\" supporters.\nThe most notable was former London Mayor Boris Johnson, who was given the meaty job of foreign secretary, Britain's top diplomatic post. The blond, Latin-speaking Johnson - a leader of the campaign for a British exit, or Brexit - had aspired to be prime minister himself before his bid failed because of party infighting.\nFormer Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was named Treasury chief, ousting George Osborne, a strong \"remain\" voice in the referendum. May's former job of home secretary went to Amber Rudd.\nMay has said she will create a new post of \"Brexit\" minister to oversee talks on a British EU exit from the 28-nation EU. That key job went to veteran Conservative lawmaker David Davis - a longstanding advocate of leaving the EU - and he will lead at least two years of negotiations with the bloc.\nWednesday's carefully orchestrated political changeover began with Cameron making a final appearance in Parliament, turning the usually raucous prime minister's question time into a session filled with praise, thanks, gentle ribbing, cheers - and a sprinkle of criticism.\nLater, in a brief speech on Downing Street, the 49-year-old Cameron defended his government's legacy.\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our country as prime minister over these last six years, and to serve as leader of my party for almost 11 years,\" he said. \"It's not been an easy journey, and of course we have not got every decision right, but I do believe that today our country is much stronger.\"\nThen, he and his wife, Samantha, and his children - 12-year-old Nancy, 10-year-old Elwen and 5-year-old Florence - left their home of six years and made the short drive to Buckingham Palace.\nThe palace soon confirmed that Cameron had \"tendered his resignation as prime minister and First Lord of the Treasury, which her majesty was graciously pleased to accept.\"\nMinutes later, the palace released a photo of May curtseying to the monarch and confirmed that the queen had \"requested her to form a new administration.\"\nAs home secretary, the 59-year-old May has been in charge of immigration and law and order for the past six years. She has the tough task of calming the country and global financial markets after the upheaval that followed the referendum.\nAlthough May had backed remaining in the EU, she has reassured \"leave\" supporters that \"Brexit means Brexit, and we will make a success of it.\"\nNot all believe her. As May spoke in front of her new residence, a small band of pro-Brexit demonstrators down the street chanted \"Theresa May, don't delay!\"\nShe is under pressure from pro-Brexit Conservatives and other EU leaders to start formal exit talks with the bloc. But Tony Travers of the London School of Economics said May probably would not rush to trigger Article 50 of the EU constitution, which starts a two-year countdown to a departure from Europe.\n\"I don't detect Theresa May being an impulsive person,\" Travers said. \"I think she's a cautious person, and the British political establishment needs to come to terms with this massive decision.\"\nCameron used his final day in office to try to stake a claim on a legacy beyond his status as the prime minister who - by gambling on a referendum - took Britain out of the EU.\nHe said his government had cut the deficit, overseen economic growth and legalized same-sex marriage. And he offered the closest thing he has ever given to a mission statement: \"I believe that politics is about public service in the national interest.\"\n\"I will miss the roar of the crowd, Cameron told Parliament. \"I will miss the barbs from the opposition.\"\nHe ended by referring to a jibe he directed at then-Prime Minister Tony Blair more than a decade ago: \"He was the future once.\"\n\"Nothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it,\" Cameron said. \"After all, as I once said, I was the future once.\""}, {"id": "162", "title": "Britain to get first female prime minister since Thatcher", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/british-prime-minister-contest-down-to-two-women-amid-eu-exit-fallout/2016/07/07/8499b76e-4390-11e6-a76d-3550dba926ac_story.html", "time_stamp": "2016:7:8 00:00:00", "content": "May and Leadsom \nstill standing in race \nto succeed Cameron\nLONDON - The race to be Britain's next prime minister was whittled to two on Thursday, with Conservative Party lawmakers ensuring that the country will have a female head of government - the nation's first since Margaret Thatcher stepped down more than a quarter-century ago.\nThe contest will pit the home affairs secretary, Theresa May, against Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom in a race that features contenders who were on opposite sides of last month's European Union referendum.\nIn a vote among 330 Tory members of Parliament, May was on top, with 199 votes, compared with 84 for Leadsom. A third candidate, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, was knocked out after securing 46 votes.\nGove had upended British politics last week by jumping into the race for prime minister at the last possible moment. The move forced the favorite, former London mayor Boris Johnson, from the contest even before he had entered. But Gove's unexpected betrayal also angered many Conservative lawmakers and prompted them to search for an alternative candidate to stand against the new front-runner, May.\nThat turned out to be Leadsom, a relative unknown in British politics who serves as a junior minister but has never been a member of the cabinet - normally a prerequisite for holding the nation's top job.\nLeadsom begins the contest as a decided underdog against the better-known May, who dominated Thursday's vote and an earlier round of balloting held Tuesday.\nBut May will need to persuade the party's rank and file, who will take the summer to choose a winner.\nShe wasted no time Thursday making her case, which has focused on the notion that she is the only one who can bring together the party's warring \"remain\" and \"leave\" factions. Leadsom draws her support principally from the leave camp.\n\"We need proven leadership to negotiate the best deal for leaving the European Union, to unite our party and our country,\" May said just moments after the vote.\nThe winner will be announced Sept. 9 and will replace David Cameron. He announced his plans to step down late last month, just a day after he was unable to persuade the country to back the remain campaign in a referendum on Britain's E.U. membership.\nEither Leadsom or May will be Britain's first female prime minister since Thatcher, who led the country from 1979 to 1990, and the second in British history.\nWith Hillary Clinton topping presidential polls in the United States and Chancellor Angela Merkel continuing to govern Germany, three of the West's leading countries could all be governed by women by January - a historic first.\nAnd in Scotland, a woman - First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - could become a chief antagonist for the new British prime minister. Scotland favored remaining in the European Union, and Sturgeon could lead Scottish efforts to seek another independence bid from the United Kingdom to stay in the E.U. fold.\nIt is just one front in the tricky post-referendum aftermath facing May or Leadsom.\nBoth candidates have vowed to follow through with a British exit from the European Union - popularly known as Brexit - by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the never-before-used mechanism by which countries can leave the 28-member bloc.\nBut they disagree about when to move. May has suggested that it will not happen this year. Leadsom has said she will act as quickly as possible, as European leaders have demanded. \"We need to get on with it,\" she recently told the BBC.\nLeadsom and May were on opposite sides of the E.U. debate. Leadsom, a former bank executive, emerged from relative obscurity by taking a leading role in the leave campaign.\nMay officially backed remain, but in practice she largely sat on the sidelines.\nShe has long held strongly Euroskeptic views and has said there will be no rerun of the referendum if she becomes prime minister. \"Brexit means Brexit,\" she said last week when she announced her candidacy.\nSeeking to assuage any doubts among leave backers, she has at times even taken a harder line than her pro-Brexit rivals. This week, for instance, she refused to guarantee that E.U. citizens living in Britain will be allowed to stay once the country has left the bloc, saying the matter is up for negotiation. Other contenders, including Leadsom, took a more conciliatory line, saying that no one would be kicked out of the country because of Brexit.\nDespite May's maneuvering, Leadsom has sought to raise questions about the home secretary's dedication to the Brexit cause. Leadsom has argued that the country can trust only a true leave champion to drive the hard bargain with Brussels on cutting ties.\nMay, who has been responsible for the country's internal security as home secretary since 2010, has suggested that Leadsom lacks the experience necessary for the country's top job. May has pointed to her own record of negotiating tough security deals with her E.U. counterparts as evidence that she is uniquely prepared for the task ahead.\nBoth Leadsom and May are to the political right of Cameron. May has taken a hard line on immigration, saying in a speech last year that mass arrivals threatened the country's \"cohesion.\" Leadsom, meanwhile, opposed the country's legalization of same-sex marriage - a move that Cameron championed.\nOf the two, Leadsom is considered more ideological, while May is seen as relatively pragmatic.\nNow that Conservative members of Parliament have picked the two finalists, it will be up to the party's 150,000 rank-and-file members to select the leader to govern this nation of 65 million.\nBecause the Conservatives won an absolute majority in Parliament in last year's general election, they do not need to go back to the public to seek a mandate for a new prime minister. Instead, party members will vote by mail through the summer.\nPolls show that May is well ahead of Leadsom among Conservative members, just as she was among the party's parliamentary delegation.\nThe vote will come as the Brexit aftershocks continue to reverberate, with markets reeling and the pound down to its lowest level in three decades. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to the investment giant Allianz, told Reuters on Thursday that the currency still has a long way to fall - and could reach parity with the dollar if British politicians do not move quickly to restore stability.\nLeadsom said Thursday that the pound's plummet is not necessarily a cause for concern, noting that it will help British exporters. In a speech in central London, Leadsom said she wants to \"banish the pessimists\" and \"spread prosperity to every corner of our country.\"\nThe speech was billed as a major economic policy address, but she gave few details of her plans.\nLeadsom stayed in the hunt for the prime minister's post despite a flurry of scrutiny over apparent exaggerations on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which suggested that she had spent years working as a fund manager for a major investment firm. Leadsom acknowledged Thursday that she had not managed funds, but she insisted that she had held a senior management job at Invesco Perpetual.\nJohnson, who backed Leadsom in a move widely perceived as revenge against Gove, issued a statement Wednesday calling her \"well placed to win and replace the absurd gloom in some quarters with a positive, confident and optimistic approach.\"\nHe also celebrated the fact that the Tories will have been responsible for both of Britain's female prime ministers, calling the center-right party \"the most progressive party in Britain.\"\ngriff.witte@washpost.com"}, {"id": "191", "title": "David Cameron Gets Hustled Out of Downing Street, but the Cat Stays", "publisher": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/world/europe/britain-downing-street-cameron-larry.html", "time_stamp": "2016:7:13 00:00:00", "content": "Theresa May, Britain\u2019s incoming prime minister, walked past Larry the Cat on her way to attend a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street in London on Tuesday.CreditCreditKirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press\nBy\u00a0Dan Bilefsky\nJuly 12, 2016\nLONDON \u2014 The cat can stay.\nThe only member of the household on Downing Street to be spared the indignity of one of the fastest political transitions in recent memory will be Larry the Cat, a tabby who holds the title of\u00a0chief mouser to the cabinet office.\nThe\u00a0sudden victory of Theresa May, Britain\u2019s home secretary, in the Conservative Party\u2019s leadership contest on Monday put Prime Minister David Cameron in the unenviable position of having to vacate his residence in about 48 hours. A large blue moving van pulled up on Downing Street on Tuesday to retrieve the Cameron family\u2019s belongings.\nIt is a rite of passage Britain has experienced many times, but one that is unfamiliar for most Americans. In the United States, a newly elected president has more than two months \u2014 between Election Day in early November and Inauguration Day, Jan. 20 \u2014 to set up a new administration.\nTransitions in Britain are far swifter. A prime minister typically takes up official residence at 10 Downing Street upon getting the job, as Mr. Cameron did in 2010, when his Conservative Party\u00a0took power\u00a0after 13 years of\u00a0Labour Party\u00a0government.\nBut the transition can seem even more jarring when a prime minister takes office without a general election. This occurred most recently in 2007, when Gordon Brown\u00a0succeeded\u00a0Tony Blair, and before that in 1990, when John Major\u00a0took over\u00a0from Margaret Thatcher.\n\u201cThe prime minister has said he is glad there will not be an elongated leadership process,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Cameron\u2019s office said in a phone interview on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because of government protocol. He noted that the need for stability engendered by Britain\u2019s\u00a0vote to leave the European Union\u00a0had created a sense of urgency. \u201cThis is how British democracy works. When the leader changes, the prime minister changes, and the evacuation of the premises soon follows. It\u2019s a quick departure, but it is what it is.\u201d\nMr. Cameron led his final cabinet meeting on Tuesday. On Wednesday, after his final prime minister\u2019s questions in Parliament, he will visit Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation. Shortly after, Ms. May will be granted an audience with the queen and invited to form a government. She and her husband, Philip, will most likely pose for a photo in front of 10 Downing Street with Mr. Cameron and his family, as their predecessors have done.\nLarry the Cat will be staying, the government spokesman said wryly, adding that Ms. May would inherit the tabby, adopted from an\u00a0animal shelter\u00a0in 2011 to\u00a0help address a rat problem.\nMr. Cameron made his resignation announcement on June 24, one day after the referendum to withdraw from the European Union, a decision commonly known as Brexit. On Monday, after he announced the timetable of his departure and expressed his support for Ms. May, he was recorded jovially humming as he re-entered 10 Downing Street, seemingly relieved.\nBut the rapid departure poses logistical challenges for Mr. Cameron and his wife, Samantha, including the question of where to live.\nThe Camerons have three children \u2014 their youngest, Florence, is 5 \u2014 and hope to stay in the capital. But their home in the North Kensington area of west London has been rented out, and their farmhouse in the hamlet of Dean, Oxfordshire, about 73 miles northwest of London, is probably too far for daily commuting.\nThe arrival of the moving van at the rear entrance on Downing Street suggested that the Camerons have at least found temporary lodgings, although officials would not confirm this.\nThe movers arrived with 330 boxes, 30 rolls of tape and three rolls of Bubble Wrap. Simply Removals, the company that handled the Camerons\u2019 move into Downing Street in 2010, and calls itself \u201cLondon\u2019s affordable removal firm,\u201d advertises a \u201cBig One\u201d package that includes 25 standard boxes, two large boxes, two wardrobe boxes, Bubble Wrap, packing paper and tape, for 169 pounds, or about $224. A recording on the company\u2019s office phone extolled its qualifications, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we were Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s choice when he first moved into No. 10.\u201d\nThe house at 10 Downing Street has been the\u00a0official residence of the prime minister\u00a0since 1735, but the Cameron family actually lives in more spacious quarters at 11 Downing Street. That house is the official residence of the chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain\u2019s finance minister. (In 2010, the chancellor, George Osborne, chose to remain at his residence in the Notting Hill section of west London.)\nPeter York, a cultural commentator, said the speed with which Mr. Cameron was being \u201cejected\u201d reflected the viciousness of the power struggle within the Conservative Party. The party has been known for disposing of its leaders with ruthless efficiency, notably in 1990 when Mrs. Thatcher was\u00a0effectively ousted in a party coup.\n\u201cHe is practically being thrown out of his house, though I dare say he will have some people to help him pack his bags,\u201d Mr. York said in a phone interview.

The results were announced Saturday in Liverpool, where the party is gathering for its annual conference.\nThe left-wing politician garnered 313,209 votes to 193,229 for Smith to win what he called his second mandate as party leader in a year. In doing so, he exceeded his share of the vote last year and tightened his grip on the top of the party.\nBut even though grass-roots activists gave Corbyn a resounding stamp of approval, Labour's troubles -- including the lowest poll ratings in decades -- are far from over as it struggles to convince more centrist voters it can win power.\nCorbyn referred to the partisan struggle that has split his party in recent months as he appealed for unity.\n\"As far as I'm concerned, let's wipe the slate clean from today and get on with the work we've got to do as a party together,\" he said.\nHe also said that \"the whole party,\" including Labour members of Parliament, had a responsibility to \"respect the democratic choice that's been made.\"\n\"Let us work together for real change in Britain,\" he said.\nResponding to the result, the governing Conservative Party said: \"After months of division and distraction, Jeremy Corbyn has won the Labour leadership election. Again.\n\"But no one should be celebrating this victory. The policies that Labour are offering will do nothing for people who want a government that will deliver for them.\"\nFrom backbench rebel to party leader\nThe UK's main opposition party has been plagued by bitter infighting since party members elected the 67-year-old Corbyn as leader following Labour's defeat in the May 2015 general election.\nAs a backbencher, the Parliament member for Islington North in London was known for his refusal to follow the party whip and for his left-wing, pro-trade union, anti-Iraq War views.\nAs leader, he wants to renationalize utility companies and make Britain non-nuclear. He considers the NATO military alliance outdated and aggressive.\nThese views, the majority of Labour lawmakers believe, make the party unelectable in a general election as Corbyn would be unable to win over centrist voters, especially on defense issues.\nCorbyn's leadership was thrown into doubt in July following mass resignations from the shadow Cabinet and the loss of a confidence vote by 172-40 from the Parliamentary Labour Party.\nAnother Parliament member, Angela Eagle, first challenged him, but she then stood down for Smith, a little known member of Parliament from Wales.\nBrexit fallout\nMany Labour Party members in and out of Parliament believe that Corbyn did not campaign hard enough in the June referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union.\nIn the past he had been anti-EU but changed tack to support the Remain campaign. The vote to exit the EU caused deep divisions in British society, and Corbyn's failure to rally Labour supporters around the EU flag left a bitter taste in the mouth of many pro-European Labour lawmakers.\nWhen Corbyn first stood for Labour leader following the party's defeat in the 2015 elections, he was largely seen as a \"fringe\" candidate, securing just 35 nominations from fellow Labour Parliament members.\nBut -- just like Sen. Bernie Sanders in the United States -- the gray-bearded Corbyn has proved a hit among the party's grass roots and young people. Many of them joined Labour at the last minute to vote for him, helping him to win the 2015 leadership contest with 59.5% of the vote.\nThis support led to a massive surge in the party's membership from a little more than 200,000 in May 2015 to well over 500,000 today, making Labour the biggest political party in Europe. The Labour Party central office was unable to confirm the exact number to date but said it was 640,000 if registered supporters and affiliated members are included.\nDiane Abbott, a Labour Parliament member and Corbyn supporter, told CNN: \"The young really like Bernie (Sanders) even though he was older than any of the other candidates in the Democratic primaries. Young people are looking for something new. And for them the sort of left politics that Jeremy's talking about is new.\"\nIs Labour unelectable?\nDespite his popularity with party activists, Corbyn continues to alienate the majority of Labour's 230 members of Parliament.\nThey complain of his weak, divisive and dogmatic leadership style and fear his left-wing views will make the party unelectable.\nHis supporters -- which the press has dubbed \"Corbynistas\" -- have formed an extra-parliamentary campaign group called Momentum.\nMany political observers have said it is only a matter of time before there's another challenge to Corbyn's leadership.\nAlready a number of members of Parliament have publicly stated they would not serve with him in a shadow Cabinet."}, {"id": "163", "title": "Britain's Labour Party leader survives challenge", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/britains-jeremy-corbyn-survives-labour-party-leadership-challenge/2016/09/24/d466e8a2-8012-11e6-ad0e-ab0d12c779b1_story.html", "time_stamp": "2016:9:25 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON - Jeremy Corbyn was reelected leader of the bitterly divided Labour Party on Saturday, just a year after his dark-horse ascension rocked Britain's political world.\nCorbyn, who has been described as Britain's Bernie Sanders, proved again he is overwhelmingly popular with the party's grass roots, seeing off his challenger, Owen Smith, by winning 61.8 percent of the vote.\n\"Let us work together for real change in Britain,\" the 67-year-old socialist said after the results were announced Saturday at the start of the Labour Party's annual conference in Liverpool.\nCorbyn also pleaded for unity in his party, which is engaged in a messy internal fight.\n\"Elections are passionate and often partisan affairs, and things are sometimes said in the heat of the debate, on all sides, which we sometimes later come to regret,\" he said. \"Let's wipe that slate clean from today.\"\nThe result was widely expected despite a bruising contest that has cast a spotlight on the deep divisions within a party that has been shut out of power since 2010.\nCorbyn may be wildly popular with the party's grass roots, but he lacks the support of many of his party's representatives in Parliament.\nA leadership contest was triggered after Britain's shock decision to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Shortly afterward, 172 of Labour's 230 lawmakers supported a vote of no confidence in their leader.\nSome cited Corbyn's leadership style as the reason he should quit, while others were critical of his performance in the E.U. referendum. Corbyn campaigned for Britain to stay in the bloc, but some say they thought his heart wasn't in it and that he didn't do enough to shore up pro-E.U. support.\nBut the rebellion backfired, with Smith failing to generate the kind of enthusiasm that burns bright among Corbyn's followers.\nThat contingent, known as Corbynistas, are energetic, enthusiastic and a force on social media. Since Corbyn became leader, large numbers of people have flocked to join the Labour Party. Corbyn told the conference that it has more than 500,000 members and is the largest political party in Western Europe.\nBut some Labour supporters worry that his appeal doesn't extend beyond a niche segment of the British electorate.\nA recent YouGov poll showed Labour trailing the Conservative Party by nine points.\nJohn Curtice, a politics professor at the University of Strathclyde, said the Labour Party's \"fundamental problem\" is that it has no one who has shown an ability to grab the attention of the wider public.\n\"There isn't anyone in the parliamentary party who has demonstrated they are up for the job,\" he said. \"At least the Corbynistas have a candidate. ... The non-Corbynistas don't.\"\nWhen Corbyn, a veteran politician from the party's left wing, won the leadership contest last year, it was widely seen as a rebuke to the Labour Party establishment and to Tony Blair, the former British prime minister who blurred the traditional distinctions between left and right during his decade in power.\nSupporters of Corbyn, many of whom are staunchly anti-Blair, say that he is a straight-talking, authentic politician who has galvanized a new generation of activists with his emphasis on creating a more equal society.\nOthers are skeptical that the mass movement inspired by Corbyn can translate into wider success in a general election, and say they worry that long, tedious years in opposition lie ahead.\nDavid Miliband, who served as Britain's foreign secretary under the Labour government of Gordon Brown, says the party has \"not been further from power since the 1930s.\"\nIn an article in the New Statesman, Miliband wrote: \"Nationalisation cannot be the answer to everything; anti-austerity speeches cannot explain everything; corporate taxation cannot pay for everything. It doesn't add up. It wouldn't work. People are not stupid.\"\nSmith repeatedly said the party risked splintering if Corbyn was reelected, but most commentators think that's unlikely for now, not least because of the lack of a charismatic politician lined up to lead the charge.\nLabour lawmakers have defected before. In the early 1980s, some 28 members of Parliament defected to create the Social Democratic Party, which would later merge with the Liberal Party to become the Liberal Democrats.\n\"The fracturing of the left at the time, what did it do? It gave the Tories 18 years of power,\" said Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna, one of the party moderates who has urged his disillusioned colleagues not to break away. Speaking to Sky News, he said: \"The Labour Party can only win when it is a broad church.\"\n\"The Labour Party is just stuck, really,\" said Tony Travers, a political expert at the London School of Economics. He added that it was a \"living nightmare for the parliamentary party\" and predicted it would not split but \"struggle on.\"\nAndy Burnham, a Labour lawmaker who lost to Corbyn in the 2015 leadership race, issued a plea for unity, saying that the party needs to shift its focus to the \"enormity of issues\" facing Britain in the wake of the Brexit decision.\nThere are \"massive stakes here,\" he told the BBC on Saturday, adding that Labour should be \"challenging what we seem to be getting, which is a hard-line Brexit, a right-wing Brexit - that's where our focus should be.\"\nBut it seems unlikely that Corbyn's reelection will halt the internal squabbles in his party.\n\"As long as the party has got a parliamentary party at odds with its leaders and a parliamentary party at odds with its membership, it's got a problem,\" said Curtice, the professor. \"We may discover we are back doing the same leadership challenge rerun in 12 months time.\""}], "20": [{"id": "20", "title": "Theresa May commits to Brexit vote in UK Parliament", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/brexit-theresa-may-speech/index.html", "time_stamp": "2017:1:17 00:00:00", "content": "British Prime Minister Theresa May committed to placing a final Brexit deal to a vote in both houses of the UK parliament, as she outlined for the first time her plan for extracting Britain from the European Union.\nIn a much-anticipated speech in London, May said that once Britain had negotiated a final deal to leave the European Union, it would be placed before the House of Commons and the House of Lords for approval.\nIn language that indicated a \"hard Brexit\", May confirmed that Britain would leave the EU single market, which guarantees the free movement of goods, services and people within the bloc. The Prime Minister made it clear that her fundamental aim was regain full control of immigration and lawmaking -- and that leaving the single market was the inevitable consequence.\nBritain could not be \"half-in, half-out\" of the EU, the Prime Minister said.\nBut she revealed that, in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU, Britain would seek an arrangement to replace the provisions of the EU customs union. Such a deal could amount to \"associatere membership\" of the customs union, she said.\nMay also warned other EU member states not to seek a \"punitive\" deal for Britain in order to send a message to Euroskeptics in other countries. Such a move would be a \"calamitous act of self-harm,\" she said.\n\"No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain,\" May declared.\nREAD: Can Brexit be undone?\nParliament given vote\nWhat May said: The Prime Minister revealed for the first time that the British government will put the final Brexit deal to a vote, meaning that members of the UK parliament could, in theory, block the deal. When asked by reporters what would happen in that scenario, May avoided a direct answer. \"I am sure the British Parliament will want to deliver the views of the British people and respect the democratic decision that was taken,\" she said.\nBut negotiations on a deal can't even begin until the British government invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets the rules of EU membership. May has said she wants to trigger the mechanism by the end of March, and did not seek to alter that timetable in her speech.\nThe UK Supreme Court is due to rule in the next few weeks on whether there must be another vote in the UK parliament before that can happen. Negotiations must then be concluded within two years.\nWhat it means: Two years is a long time in British politics, and it's hard to predict the outcome of a parliamentary vote before talks have even started on a deal. But analysts expect that, if there is not a general election in the meantime, May would prevail.\n\"There are so many unknowns,\" Quentin Peel, associate fellow of the Europe Program at the Chatham House think tank, told CNN. \"Are we going to have an election before it gets to that stage? What will the make up of the House of Commons be?\"\nPeel noted that May refused to be drawn on whether a vote against the deal in Parliament would mean that Britain could remain a member of the EU -- or a departure without a deal. \"If the option is the deal you've negotiated or no deal at all but still leaving then I think that would put huge pressure on Parliament to agree to it.\n\"But if there were an option to go back in [to the EU] then it's a little bit uncertain.\"\nOPINION: Theresa May's Brexit confidence is deeply misguided\nSingle market and customs union\nWhat May said: May was clear on Britain leaving the single market in an effort to pursue what she called a \"bold and ambitious free trade agreement.\" But she said that the UK would attempt to negotiate as much access as possible to it, without having to sign up to obligations on the free movement of people.\nMay said the UK would try to keep some kind of relationship with the customs union, which allows for the tariff-free movement of goods in the EU, to ensure that cross-border trade is \"as frictionless as possible.\"\nWhat it means: As an EU member, the UK trades freely with the other 27 EU countries. That two-way flow was worth about \u00c2\u00a3513 billion in 2015, just over half the UK's total. A new EU-UK deal will now have to be struck.\nBut it doesn't end there. The EU manages preferential trade deals with nearly 60 other nations on behalf of its members. The UK will have to seek new ties with those countries.\nOn May's plan to strike a new customs deal, Tom Raines, a research fellow at the Europe Program at Chatham House, said it would \"require some creative thinking to reduce the regulatory burden.\"\nImmigration\nWhat May said: The Prime Minister said she wanted to guarantee the rights of EU citizens already in Britain and British citizens in other EU states \"as early as we can.\" But she was unable to offer any more clarity than that.\nAddressing future immigration from European countries, May said: \"Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. And that is what we will deliver.\"\nWhat it means: For EU citizens living in Britain, there was no comfort. The Prime Minister made it clear that their status was up for negotiation, and depended on the rights conferred on British citizens living in the European Union.\n\"For member states with a big diaspora in the UK, this is a big issue and eastern European states have been quite vocal about it,\" said Stephen Booth, Acting Director and Director of Policy and Research at Open Europe.\n\"The issue has been that the EU has had the mantra of no negotiating before Article 50 is triggered which led to a stalemate.\n\"The government has said that it will be dealing with this straight away. It understands the individuals concerned want to know what is happening as well as the business community, who want to know about their workplace.\"\nMaintaining the unity of the UK\nWhat May said: The Prime Minister said she would put preservation of \"our precious union\" at the heart of the negotiation with Europe -- a reference to the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU.\nMay said she would seek input on the deal from the UK nations and regions. \"We won't agree on everything, but I look forward to working with the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to deliver a Brexit that works for the whole of the United Kingdom,\" May said.\nWhat it means: Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon has made little secret of her desire to launch a second independence referendum should May seek to leave the single market.\nSturgeon issued a stout response on Tuesday. \"Scotland did not vote for the direction set out in the Prime Minister's speech today -- and it is not in our national interests,\" she said.\nIt seems likely that May is heading for a showdown with the Scottish government. But Peel said the Scottish First Minister was on the back foot. \"She's been told today, 'get lost, we're not staying in the single market,\" he said.\nREAD: Scotland considers 2nd independence referendum\nThe collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland last week raises an added complication for May, should Brexit become an issue in the elections that have been called for March.\nLand border with European Union\nWhat May said: Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, there is currently an open border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. But critics have questioned whether an open border can be maintained after Britain leaves the EU, with Ireland staying in.\nMay said bringing about a solution would be an \"important priority\" adding that \"nobody wants to return to the borders of the past, so we will make it a priority to deliver a practical solution as soon as we can.\"\nWhat it means: \"The Achilles heel of the entire negotiation process is Ireland and Northern Ireland,\" Peel told CNN.\n\"It's a huge question as to whether some sort of border will have to be reinserted there. It is fundamental to the peace agreement that the population of Northern Ireland has the right to have Irish citizenship as well as British citizenship."}, {"id": "21", "title": "Can Brexit be undone?", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/brexit-can-it-be-undone/index.html", "time_stamp": "2017:1:17 00:00:00", "content": "British Prime Minister Theresa May has set out her vision for Britain outside the European Union, making it clear she will pursue what critics have called a \"hard Brexit.\"\nIn a highly anticipated speech Tuesday in London, the Conservative leader pledged that Parliament would get a vote on the Brexit deal Britain reaches with the EU.\n\"The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union,\" May said. \"My job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do.\"\nMany are now asking if Brexit can be undone.\nWhat's the short answer? It would be very difficult.\nWhat is the vote?\nIn her speech, May promised that both the House of Commons and House of Lords would be given the opportunity to vote on the final Brexit deal. But talks around a deal can't begin until the British government invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, formally notifying the EU of its intention to withdraw from the union. So the vote will take place after Brexit is already well underway.\nMay has said she will trigger Article 50 by the end of March. The UK Supreme Court is due to rule in the next few weeks on whether there must be a vote in Parliament before that can happen.\nThe likelihood of Parliament challenging Article 50 is low, said Quentin Peel, an associate fellow with the Europe program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.\n\"What Theresa May was trying to do today was ensure that she keeps a majority to go ahead with Article 50,\" Peel told CNN. \"The only thing that would stop this happening is a split in the Conservative Party and that, at this moment, doesn't look very likely.\"\nWhat happens if Parliament passes the deal?\nNegotiations on the final Brexit deal are expected to take at least two years before being put to Parliament for a vote.\nThe terms of the deal are as yet unknown; however, May laid out some of the key parameters Tuesday for her plan to extract Britain from the EU. Among them, May confirmed that Britain would leave the EU single market, which ensures the free movement of goods, services and people within the bloc. She revealed that Britain would seek an arrangement to replace the provisions of the EU customs union.\nMay also indicated that her aim was to regain full control of immigration and lawmaking.\nBut beyond that, the Prime Minister did not offer much more in the way of clarity.\nWhile May underlined that she wanted to guarantee the rights of EU citizens already in Britain and British citizens in other EU states, she made it clear that they were up for negotiation.\nBeyond immigration, there is also a question mark over what will happen to Britain's open border with Ireland as well as the \"precious union\" of the United Kingdom's constituent parts -- Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nWhat happens if it doesn't?\nWhen asked what would happen if Parliament voted against the deal, May said, \"I am sure the British Parliament will want to deliver the views of the British people and respect the democratic decision that was taken.\"\nBut what does \"no deal for Britain\" actually look like? At the moment, it isn't clear, and a lot could change in two years.\n\"Because Theresa May has now conceded that she will at least put it to a vote in Parliament, there must be an outside chance that it would be reversible,\" Peel said.\n\"Say she comes back in two years with a deal and Parliament decided that it was a lousy deal,\" Peel said. \"What would the consequences be for voting it down? Would voting no to the outcome mean we go back to square one, or would it actually result in Britain falling out of the European Union with no agreement at all ... in a complete chaotic mess?\"\nArticle 50 states that the leaving country ceases to be a member of the EU two years after triggering the process unless the European Council unanimously agrees an extension of negotiation. So if Parliament voted down a deal, then Britain would exit without any kind of deal at all once two years had elapsed.\nA new anti-Brexit court case, to be launched in Dublin by the end of January, will look at whether Article 50 can be reversed after it has been triggered. The verdict may give us a better understanding of what might happen if Parliament votes against a Brexit deal.\nWhat else could derail Brexit?\nThere are a number of things up in the air that could slow down the Brexit deal -- namely Scotland and Northern Ireland. Although the majority of British citizens opted to leave the EU in last year's referendum, a majority of Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.\nExperts say they are unlikely to derail a deal, but if the devolved parliaments in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are entitled to vote on triggering Article 50, it could delay Brexit further.\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a swift and strong response to May's speech on Tuesday, saying that leaving the single market would be \"economically catastrophic.\" The Scottish government has previously raised the prospect of a second independence referendum if Scotland's membership of the single market was threatened.\nBut Scotland is not the only concern.\nPeel said that elections across Europe this year could make negotiating a deal slow-going.\n\"We have Dutch elections, French elections, possibly Italian elections and German elections. All of those countries are going to be looking inward for the rest of this year. We aren't going to have a new German government until December,\" Peel said."}, {"id": "164", "title": "In Britain, 'remainers' find hope in Brexit court decision", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-britain-remainers-find-hope-in-brexit-court-decision/2016/11/04/2596b078-a28b-11e6-8864-6f892cad0865_story.html", "time_stamp": "2016:11:5 00:00:00", "content": "Government says \nit will appeal ruling to Supreme Court \nLONDON - A day after the stunning High Court ruling that threatens to derail British Prime Minister Theresa May's plans to withdraw from the European Union, few in Britain were suggesting that Brexit is dead.\nBut for the first time since the June 23 referendum that so crushed pro-E.U. voters, there were glimmers of hope on the \"remain\" side that Britain will opt for something other than a hard exit from the E.U.\n\"It's the first piece of good news they have had since June,\" said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, referring to those who voted to stay in the union. \"But I don't think anyone should be celebrating in the sense that this could scupper Brexit. But it does mean the government has lost the initiative.\"\nBritons voted 52 to 48 to leave the E.U. but not on what the departure would look like.\nAll the noises coming from the British government until now have indicated that the country was veering toward a \"hard\" Brexit, which many take to mean prioritizing controls on the free movement of people over access to the E.U.'s single market.\nBut the government's chess table was toppled Thursday after three High Court judges ruled that May has to consult with Parliament before triggering Article 50, which would start the two-year divorce proceedings.\nAdding to May's woes, her Conservative party's slim majority in the House of Commons was reduced Friday when Stephen Phillips, a pro-Brexit Conservative member of Parliament, resigned over \"irreconcilable differences\" with the government. He had said in previous interviews that he was deeply unhappy with the government's handling of Brexit.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told a news conference in Berlin on Friday that the government would fight the ruling in the Supreme Court, and that their timetable for withdrawing from the E.U. remains unchanged.\n\"It's very important to recognize that the British people voted to leave the European Union,\" he said. \"That is what we are going to get on and do.\"\nBut the Thursday ruling, if upheld, means that instead of one step involved in triggering Article 50 - May penning a letter to Brussels at some point before her self-imposed deadline of the end of March - it could now involve multiple steps.\nThe majority of lawmakers voted to \"remain\" in the E.U., but there have been few calls since the referendum to contradict the electorate and block Brexit.\nOne headline in the pro-E.U. Guardian newspaper on Friday said, \"Ardent remainers: don't let high court decision raise your hopes.\"\nBut analysts said that Parliament's involvement could hugely complicate May's exit strategy.\nIf the government loses its case in the Supreme Court next month, Parliament would probably need to pass legislation before triggering Article 50. It is unclear what that would look like, but any such act could be subject to amendments by both houses of Parliament. It also is an open question as to how long that would take.\nSome of those who campaigned for Brexit argue that Thursday's ruling is an establishment setup, a way to ignore the democratic will of the British people who decisively voted to leave the bloc.\nThe Daily Mail newspaper featured pictures Friday of the three High Court judges on its front page under the headline \"Enemies of the People.\" In an editorial, the Sun newspaper asked whether politicians would honor the \"biggest ballot box mandate in British history\" or \"sniffily decide the little people cannot be trusted.\"\nNigel Farage, a prominent Brexiteer and the interim leader of the U.K. Independence Party, tweeted: \"My fear is we now get half Brexit.

The House of Lords, the upper chamber, has more than 800 members.\nAnthony King, a professor of government at the University of Essex, said that the impact of having to consult with Parliament means that \"the number of potential veto players or politicians of influence has suddenly increased.\"\n\"It may never happen,\" King said of Britain's departure from the E.U. \"And if it does happen, it will be as soft as the remainers and the people who want a soft exit can possibly hope for.\""}], "21": [{"id": "22", "title": "Article 50: UK's path to Brexit, explained", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/europe/article-50-what-is-it/index.html", "time_stamp": "2017:1:23 00:00:00", "content": "British voters opted out of the European Union in last year's historic referendum, but Brexit can't actually get underway until Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is triggered.\nSo what is Article 50?\nThe Lisbon Treaty, which came into effect in 2009, is one of two treaties that make up the constitutional foundations of the European Union.

Doing so would open the door for EU negotiations, which are likely to last two years.\nMay had promised lawmakers a vote on the outcome of the talks, but wanted to begin the process without a decision in parliament.\nWhat the court said\nThe Supreme Court judges voted eight to three against the government, upholding a November High Court decision. The judges, who deliberated the case over four days in December, said that the legal consequences of leaving the EU were great enough to require an act of parliament to start the process.\n\"To proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuries,\" Lord David Neuberger, president of the Supreme Court, said as he read out the ruling.\nBut the court decided that the UK government did not need the approval of devolved governments in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales to begin the negotiating process.\nThat decision is likely to be met with relief at 10 Downing Street, as 62% of Scots voted to remain in the EU in last June's referendum.\nWhat the UK government said\nThe government said it was disappointed by the ruling, but would abide by it.\nJeremy Wright, the Attorney General for England and Wales, told reporters outside the court that ministers would \"comply with the judgment of the court and do everything necessary to implement it.\"\nBut a spokesperson for Theresa May said the ruling would not change the government's Brexit timeline.\n\"The British people voted to leave the EU, and the government will deliver on their verdict -- triggering Article 50, as planned, by the end of March.

The SNP said on Tuesday that it would table 50 \"serious and substantive\" amendments to the government's bill.\nTim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the party would vote against the triggering of Article 50 unless the government promised a referendum on the terms of the final exit deal with the EU.\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, the biggest opposition group in the House of Commons, said on Twitter that his party would seek to amend the Article 50 bill \"to prevent the Conservatives using Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven.\"\nBut Labour has made it clear that it would not ultimately stand in May's way, meaning the government is likely to win the eventual vote on Article 50.\nWill Brexit lead to the breakup of Britain?\nIn their ruling, the Supreme Court judges rejected an argument that devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had the right to be consulted on the Article 50 process.

The pound has fallen about 20 percent against the dollar since the vote on concern about slower economic growth and reduced investment.\nMay's government fought hard to avoid putting the matter before Parliament, in part because amendments to the legislation could delay her timetable and force her into complicated concessions with her own lawmakers before she even sat across the table before the other 27 members of the EU.\n\"Unfortunately for businesses and other institutions, Brexit still means uncertainty,\" said Phillip Souta, head of UK public policy at the law firm Clifford Chance. \"Parliament remains divided and the outcome of the negotiations remain unknown.\"\nPutting the issue before Parliament is not a simple matter. While May holds sway in the House of Commons, the House of Lords have in recent years stalled dozens of pieces of legislation with which they disagreed, including an attempt by May's predecessor to impose welfare cuts on the vulnerable. The government backed down after the delay.\n\"Defeat in the House of Lords would not stop Brexit from happening, but it could delay it until mid-2020,\" Souta said.\nThe lawsuit was considered the most important constitutional case in a generation because it centered on the question of who ultimately wields power in Britain's system of government: the prime minister and her Cabinet, or Parliament.\nMay had said she would use centuries-old powers known as royal prerogative to invoke Article 50 of the EU treaty and launch two years of exit talks. The powers - traditionally held by the monarch - permit decisions about treaties and other specific issues to be made without a vote of Parliament.\nThe prime minister argued that the referendum gave her a mandate to take Britain out of the 28-nation bloc and that discussing the details of her strategy with Parliament would weaken the government's negotiating position.\nFinancial entrepreneur Gina Miller sued to force the government to seek parliamentary approval. Leaving the EU, she said, would change the fundamental rights of citizens and this can't be done without a vote of lawmakers. The Supreme Court agreed.\n\"The referendum is of great political significance, but the act of Parliament which established it did not say what should happen as a result, so any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way permitted by the U.K. constitution, namely by an act of Parliament,\" Supreme Court President David Neuberger said in reading the decision.\n\"To proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuries,\" he said.\nSignificantly, the government did win one argument on Tuesday, with the ruling that the legislatures of the nations that are a part of the United Kingdom - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - do not need to be consulted on Brexit. Such consultation would likely have led to a significant delay as lawmakers from the regions piled in with their concerns.\nWhile the U.K. government has ceded authority over many local issues to these bodies, responsibility for international relations still rests with the government in Westminster. \"Relations with the EU are a matter for the UK government,\" Neuberger said.\nThe government of Scotland, where voters overwhelmingly supported continued EU membership, has been an outspoken opponent of the prime minister's plans for Brexit, and opposition to Tuesday's ruling was immediately evident. The Scottish National Party, the third-largest party in the House of Commons, pledged to put forward 50 amendments.\nThe government may be forced to listen: Any sign that its voice is being ignored will feed into the case of those arguing Scotland should be an independent country.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party wouldn't frustrate the process but would seek to amend the legislation to make sure the government is held \"accountable.\"\nMiller, co-founder of SCM Direct, an online investment manager, had argued the case wasn't about blocking Brexit but about \"democracy\" and the \"dangerous precedent\" that a government can overrule Parliament.\nFor Miller, who brought the case along with hairdresser Deir Dos Santos, the court's decision meant vindication after months of threats to her security that followed her involvement in the case.\nThe case revolved around an argument that dates back almost 400 years as to whether power ultimately rests in the executive or Parliament.\nConstitutional expert Andrew Blick, an expert on the Magna Carta at King's College London, said that advocates of withdrawal had long argued that leaving the EU would protect parliamentary sovereignty.\n\"They claimed that leaving would promote the principle that the U.K. Parliament is the ultimate source of constitutional authority in the UK,\" said Blick, who advised the Welsh government on the case. \"That principle has now come back to bite them.\"\nUnderscoring the importance of the case, May put Attorney General Jeremy Wright in charge of the legal team fighting the suit. Wright had argued the suit was an attempt to put a legal obstacle in the way of enacting the referendum result.\nThe decision is a bad defeat for May and means that the government \"still does not have control of the Brexit timetable,\" said David Allen Green, a lawyer at the London legal firm Preiskel & Co."}, {"id": "165", "title": "Court: Parliament gets a say on Brexit", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/britains-supreme-court-rules-parliament-must-have-a-say-on-brexit/2017/01/24/829e5c7e-e194-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html", "time_stamp": "2017:1:25 00:00:00", "content": "Ruling adds hurdles but is not expected to derail Britain's split from E.U.\nLONDON - Britain's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Prime Minister Theresa May must get Parliament to sign off before triggering Britain's exit from the European Union.\nThe decision adds a significant hurdle to May's promise to invoke Article 50 - the never-before-used mechanism for getting out of the E.U. - by the end of March. \nMost observers, however, do not expect the decision to derail the Brexit process, set in motion when the country voted for departure by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent in a June referendum.\nDespite most members of Parliament having opposed Brexit, the political costs of blocking it now are seen as high.

The government appealed the ruling, but the Supreme Court voted 8 to 3 to endorse the High Court's stance.\nMiller celebrated the decision, calling it confirmation that \"only Parliament can grant rights to the British people, and only Parliament can take them away.

Faced with the decision of the elected Commons, the Lords backed down and approved it without amendments.\nLabour peer Dianne Hayter, who proposed the amendment on EU citizens, said the Lords had done their best, but \"our view has been rejected in the elected House of Commons, and it is clear the government is not for turning.\"\nOnce the bill receives royal assent - a formality that should be accomplished within hours - May will be free to invoke Article 50 of the EU's key treaty, triggering two years of exit negotiations, by her self-imposed deadline of March 31.\nMay was forced to seek Parliament's approval for the move after a Supreme Court ruling in January torpedoed her attempt to start the process of leaving the bloc without a parliamentary vote.\nThe House of Commons and House of Lords battled over the bill's contents, with the status of EU nationals in Britain - and Britons in fellow EU member countries - drawing especially emotional debate.\nBoth British and EU officials have said such residents should be guaranteed the right to stay where they are, but the two sides have so far failed to provide a concrete guarantee, leaving millions of people in limbo.\nScottish National Party lawmaker Joanna Cherry told the House of Commons that one constituent, a Lithuanian, had told her \"the uncertainty caused by this government and this Parliament is making her feel worse about her personal situation in Britain than she did in Lithuania under the Soviets.\"\nBrexit Secretary David Davis told lawmakers the government had a \"moral responsibility\" to the 3 million EU citizens living in Britain and the 1 million Britons in other member states, and intends to guarantee their rights as soon as possible after exit talks start.\n\"That is why we must pass this straightforward bill without further delay, so the prime minister can get to work on the negotiations and we can secure a quick deal that secures the status of both European Union citizens in the U.K. and also U.K. nationals living in the EU,\" he said.\nPro-EU lawmakers accused the government and Brexit-backing lawmakers of running roughshod over the concerns of the 48 percent of Britons who voted to stay in the EU.\nConservative legislator Dominic Grieve called the government's opposition of handing Parliament a final vote on Brexit \"deranged,\" and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas said lawmakers should not just hand ministers a blank check.\n\"We were not elected to be lemmings,\" Lucas said.\nEuroskeptics accused pro-EU legislators of trying to frustrate the will of voters who passed a June referendum to leave the EU.\n\"The simple truth is this - deal or no deal, vote or no vote, positive vote or negative vote, this process is irreversible,\" Conservative legislator Edward Leigh said. \"We're leaving the EU, and that's what the people want.\"\nMay is now free to trigger Article 50 as early as Tuesday, but the government signaled the move would come much closer to the March 31 deadline.\nMay spokesman James Slack repeated the government's position that it would happen by the end of March.\n\"I've said 'end' many times, but it would seem I didn't put it in capital letters strongly enough,\" he said.\nThe government's satisfaction at victory in Parliament was tempered by the prospect of an independence vote that threatens the 300-year old political union between England and Scotland.\nSturgeon said she would seek to hold a referendum between the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 so Scottish voters could make an \"informed choice\" about their future.\nWhile Britons overall voted to leave the EU, Scottish voters backed remaining by 62 to 38 percent, and Sturgeon said they should not be forced to follow the rest of the U.K. into a \"hard Brexit\" outside the EU single market.\nIn a 2014 referendum, Scottish voters rejected independence by a margin of 55 percent to 45 percent. But Sturgeon said the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU had brought about a \"material change of circumstances.\"\nMay - whose government would have to approve a legally binding referendum - accused Sturgeon's Scottish National Party of political \"tunnel vision\" and called her announcement \"deeply regrettable.\"\n___"}], "26": [{"id": "31", "title": "Brexit: Royal assent given as Article 50 trigger moves nearer", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/16/europe/brexit-royal-assent-eu-article-50/index.html", "time_stamp": "2017:3:16 00:00:00", "content": "Britain's exit from the European Union moved another step closer Thursday after the legislation enabling the country's departure was given royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe Queen's signature means that British Prime Minister Theresa May is now able to move forward and trigger Article 50, allowing formal talks to begin between Downing Street and the EU's 27 member states on the terms of the divorce.\nThe negotiations are expected to take up to two years once May finally invokes the leaving mechanism later this month.\nWhat is royal assent?\nThe news of the royal assent was announced in the House of Commons by the Speaker of the House.\nAfter a bill passes both the House of Commons and House of Lords, it requires royal assent to become law.\nThat means that the head of the British monarchy must sign the bill before it becomes an Act of Parliament.\nSuch a process has become a formality in modern times.

But it will seek a 'bold and ambitious' free-trade agreement. The UK hopes to avoid a cliff-edge separation and ensure certainty for businesses. It warns that European security will be under threat if a deal is not reached. It expects the devolved regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be granted greater powers. The government aims to repeal EU laws and automatically adopt them into UK law for review. A White Paper on how to do this will be published Thursday.\nTalks to begin\nThe triggering of Article 50 starts the clock ticking on two years of talks between May's government and the EU, which will involve everything from deals on trade, migration, education and healthcare.\nIn the House of Commons, May promised to represent all of the UK in the negotiations to come.\n\"When I sit around the negotiating table in the months ahead, I will represent every person in the whole United Kingdom -- young and old, rich and poor, city, town, country and all the villages and hamlets in between. And yes, those EU nationals who have made this country their home.\"\nBut she said she accepted that some consequences were inevitable.\n\"We understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU. We know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We know that UK companies that trade with the EU will have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part, just as we do in other overseas markets. We accept that.\"\nMay had vowed to weather the storm of Britain's exit from the EU's single market and customs union, essentially a free-trade zone that the country will no longer be a part of.\nThe EU is the UK's biggest trading partner, and experts have warned that striking a comprehensive trade deal in two years will be unlikely. The two parties can, however, continue trade talks beyond this period.\nEven if some terms of divorce are not settled, the UK will fall out of the union on March 29, 2019. They can split earlier if both parties agree.\n\"The talks will be exhausting, sometimes frustrating and mind-numbingly intricate,\" said CNN political contributor Robin Oakley.\n\"It seems almost impossible that a full deal on trade can be reached in two years. Some of the immediate questions can be settled, but Canada has been doing a trade deal with the European Union, and Canada hasn't just had a divorce from the European Union. Canada wanted a deal, the EU wanted a deal -- it's taken seven years.\"\nReaction\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the May government was taking the country in a direction that was \"reckless and damaging.\"\nHe criticized May's earlier statements that her government would take no trade deal over a bad deal, and trade under default rules set out by the World Trade Organization.\n\"It would be a national failure of historic proportions if the Prime Minister comes back from Brussels without having secured protection for jobs and living standards,' he said.\nBut one of the main architects of Brexit, Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK Independence Party, was jubilant.\n\"The impossible dream is happening. Today we pass the point of no return,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nIn the seaside resort of Blackpool in north-west England, where the leave vote was a resounding 67.5%, there was a sense of optimism in the air.\n\"I feel like we're going to be free.

A final trade deal would not be concluded until after Brexit.\nAccording to the negotiating guidelines, progress on a number of key areas must be made before preliminary discussions on trade can start. They include:\nprotecting the rights of EU citizens in Britain and UK citizens in other EU nations; working out the bill for Britain's exit, based on its financial commitments and liabilities; establishing a clear legal framework to avoid uncertainty for businesses and institutions; how to maintain a \"soft\" border between the Republican of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, and Northern Ireland, part of the UK.\n\"These four issues are all part of the first phase of our negotiations,\" Tusk said in Valletta, Malta, where center-right EU leaders are meeting.\n\"Once, and only once we have achieved sufficient progress on the withdrawal, can we discuss the framework for our future relationship. Starting parallel talks on all issues at the same time, as suggested by some in the UK, will not happen.\"\n'Damage control'\nTusk said the EU would \"firmly stand by\" the proposals in the document and characterized the thorny process ahead as, in essence, \"damage control.\"\n\"The talks which are about to start will be difficult, complex and sometimes even confrontational. There is no way around it. The EU27 does not and will not pursue a punitive approach. Brexit in itself is already punitive enough,\" he said.\nBut after more than 40 years of marriage, he said, \"we owe it to each other to do everything we can to make this divorce as smooth as possible.\"\nThe British government said it looked forward to beginning negotiations once the draft guidelines have been formally agreed by the other 27 EU states.

Based on the Union's interests, the European Council stands ready to initiate work towards such an agreement, to be finalised and concluded once the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State,\" the document says.\nThe draft guidelines also recognize the possibility that talks between Britain and the EU members might fail.\n\"In these negotiations the Union will act as one.

Britain joined the group that became the European Union in 1973, so decades of ties, pacts and arrangements are part of the complex unraveling.\nFor both sides, the stakes are enormous. \nBritain could be forced to reorient its economy - the world's fifth largest - if it loses favorable terms with its biggest trade partner. It also may not survive the departure in one piece, with Scotland threatening to bolt. \nThe European Union, which for decades has only expanded its integrative reach, faces perhaps an even greater existential threat. If Britain is able to secure an attractive deal, other countries contemplating their own departures could speed toward the exits.\nThe formal declaration of Britain's intention came in the form of a letter from May to Tusk. The letter, which opened with the handwritten salutation \"Dear President Tusk\" and ended with a scrawled prime-ministerial signature, was delivered by Britain's ambassador to the E.U., Tim Barrow.\nTusk later tweeted a photo of the moment he received the letter as the men stood in front of E.U. flags and Union Jacks. Barrow appeared to be grinning; Tusk was grimacing.\nFrom both sides of the English Channel on Wednesday, there were attempts to take the heat out of what had become a grievance-filled split even before it officially got underway. \nThe top diplomat for the European Union's most powerful member, Germany, said he wished Britain well.\n\"The stale-sounding sentence used in private life after a divorce, 'Let's remain friends,' is right in this case,\" said German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel.\nMay's letter, meanwhile, ratcheted down earlier threats to walk away from talks and leave with no deal - an option popularly known as \"dirty Brexit\" - if the E.U. offers are not to her liking.\nThe letter urged the European Union to let Britain go \"in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side.\"\nMay has said Britain will prioritize regaining control over immigration and exempting itself from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. She has also acknowledged that Britain will be leaving Europe's common market and its customs union. Instead, she has sought a new trade deal that reflects, as the letter described it, Britain's \"deep and special partnership\" with the European Union.\nMay's largely conciliatory tone appeared to soften European concerns that British demands were destined for a head-on collision with their own.\nNonetheless, the letter also unleashed some implicit threats. It raised, for instance, the specter that Britain could reduce its contributions to European intelligence and security if London does not get what it wants in a trade deal.\n\"In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened,\" she wrote in a passage that drew scorn from European officials who accused her of using security as a bargaining chip.\nThe British public defied predictions in June by opting to leave, voting 52 percent to 48 percent in a referendum. Polls show that voters who backed \"leave\" were driven by concerns that immigration was out of control under the E.U.'s free-movement laws and that Britain needed to exit the bloc to restore its sovereignty. \nAdvocates for \"remain\" have forecast grievous economic harm and a weaker British role in global affairs. \nAs Britain prepares to exit, it continues to be deeply divided. Opinion polls show the country is split almost as evenly today as it was in June.\nThe still-raw divisions were on vivid display Wednesday when May made her case to members of Parliament. She was cheered by Brexit backers and jeered by its opponents as she announced that Britons \"are going to make our own decisions and our own laws. We are going to take control of the things that matter most to us.\"\nAfter May ticked off the potential benefits of Brexit, the opposition leader, Labour Party head Jeremy Corbyn, enumerated the possible pitfalls, calling the prime minister's Brexit strategy \"reckless and damaging.\"\nAlthough some legal experts say that an Article 50 declaration is technically reversible, British and E.U. officials have both said they believe it is not. The delivery of the letter was a victory for May, who stepped into the vacuum left in July when her predecessor, David Cameron, abruptly resigned after the public disregarded his call to stay in the E.U.\nAlthough May was herself quietly in favor of \"remain\" during the campaign, she pivoted quickly in the aftermath of the vote and adamantly maintained that she would make good on the public will. \"Brexit means Brexit,\" she repeatedly declared. \nIt was not until January, however, that May gave true shape to what Brexit might mean. In a speech at London's Lancaster House, May made the case for a clean break from the European Union, saying she did not want a deal that would leave Britain \"half-in, half-out.\"\nBut May's pitch has done little to bring the country together.\nOf the four nations that make up the United Kingdom, only two - England and Wales - voted for Brexit. The other two, Scotland and Northern Ireland, came down against it. \nScotland's semiautonomous Parliament voted Tuesday to seek another independence referendum. Advocates argue that an E.U. departure against the will of Scottish voters has sufficiently changed the calculus since the last independence vote, in 2014, and that a new one is justified. \nIrish nationalists in Northern Ireland have also used Brexit to renew their decades-long efforts to break away from Britain. \nAmid British divisions, Europe has taken an unusually united stand in asserting that Britain will not get a better deal than the one it has today. If it does, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other stalwart defenders of the E.U. fear that Britain's departure could be just the start of a broader splintering. \nTusk, a former Polish prime minister, said his side would hold firm in negotiations over the coming two years and that the interests of the bloc's remaining 440 million citizens would take priority over concessions to Britain. A first statement of the E.U.'s bargaining positions is expected Friday. \n\"Our goal is clear,\" Tusk said. \"To minimize the costs for the E.U. citizens, businesses and member states.\"\nBecause of French elections this spring and then German elections in the fall, Britain's E.U. divorce talks are likely to get off to a slow start. Once the negotiations begin in earnest, there will be little time to finish. The talks are capped at two years, meaning they must be completed by March 2019. The real deadline is likely to be sooner, given that all E.U. parliaments will have to approve any new trade agreement.\nDespite the risks, Britain's impending exit was celebrated Wednesday by the country's staunchly pro-Brexit tabloids. \n\"Freedom!\" exulted the front page of the Daily Mail. \nThe mood was far more somber among E.U. advocates. Before walking away from the podium Wednesday, Tusk had a poignant final message for Britain: \n\"We already miss you.\"\ngriff.witte@washpost.com\nmichael.birnbaum@washpost.com"}, {"id": "196", "title": "Two years of Brexit negotiations begin this morning.", "publisher": "CBS News Transcripts CBS THIS MORNING", "url": "", "time_stamp": "2017:3:29 00:00:00", "content": "Two years of Brexit negotiations begin this morning. Britain`s prime minister is about to officially trigger her country`s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the EU constitution. Here is a live look at the House of Commons, where Theresa May is taking questions from lawmakers before delivering her statement on Brexit. Jonathan Vigliotti is outside the Houses of Parliament. Jonathan, good morning.\nJONATHAN VIGLIOTTI (CBS News Correspondent): Good morning. Triggering Article 50 is really just a nice way of saying filing for divorce. And just like any split, leaving the EU won`t be pretty.\n(Begin VT)\nJONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: The sun has risen on a breakup many in the U.K. and throughout Europe hoped wouldn`t happen, but later in Brussels, where the European Union is headquartered, the divorce papers will be filed. Prime Minister Theresa May signed the official letter Tuesday. In a statement she said, \"It is my fierce determination to get the right deal for every single person in this country.\" Later saying that includes EU nationals who have, quote, \"made this country their home.\"\nWOMAN: The countdown is on. The deadline--\nJONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: British news is already counting down the seven hundred and thirty days to the separation right to the second. This two-year divorce process could require Britain to borrow as much as seventy-three billion dollars. On the line the U.K.`s international trading relationships and free passage to the twenty-seven other member nations. Negotiating between countries will be as complicated and historic as it sounds.\nNIGEL FARAGE (Former UK Independence Party Head): What is for certain is that we`re getting back control of our country. And in future when we get things right or get things wrong, we will be in charge.\nJONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: The referendum to leave the EU or Brexit was just narrowly passed last summer. And some who voted to leave said they were tricked by politicians who oversold non-existent healthcare benefits and promised to stop immigration. Prime Minister May has already found a helping hand in the process from President Trump, who told her the Brexit would be wonderful.\nALEX SALMOND (Parliament Member): The English are split down the middle. Theresa May has divided the entire fundament of these islands. The only person she`s not fighting off is Donald Trump.\n(End VT)\nJONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: And two nations may not be enough. And the EU certainly hoping the U.K. feels the pain, Gayle, to send a clear message to other member nations who may be thinking about leaving.\nGAYLE KING: Thank you, Jonathan Vigliotti, reporting from London.\nThe top United States commander in Iraqi says there is a fair chance an American airstrike played a role in killing civilians in Mosul. The comments yesterday are the Pentagon`s fullest acceptance of responsibility since the March seventeenth airstrike. Mosul residents say it killed at least one hundred people there. American officials are now investigating whether ISIS is also to blame. Amnesty International said yesterday the United States`-led coalition is not doing enough to protect civilians. The U.N. says at least three hundred and seven civilians have been killed in Western Mosul since mid February.\nCHARLIE ROSE: A passenger plane burst into flames after it slid off a runway in central Peru. Thick black smoke poured from the jet as crews tried to put out the fire. All one hundred and forty-one people on board were able to get off safely. The Boeing airliner was trying to land at a small airport, about one hundred miles east of Lima yesterday. Officials say the fire most likely started when a wing scraped the runway. No one was seriously hurt.\nNORAH O`DONNELL: Are some U.S. charter schools part of a scheme to fund an overseas group accused in a violent coup attempt?

The Washington Post says President Trump is likely to sign a bill that would kill landmark privacy protections for the internet. The House followed the Senate`s lead yesterday and passed the measure. It would let internet providers sell information about their customers` browsing habits.\nGAYLE KING: The Los Angeles Times reports that Wells Fargo has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit. It`s over the bank`s former practice of opening millions of unauthorized accounts. So far customers have received just over three million dollars in refunds. In the new settlement, Wells Fargo has agreed to pay one hundred and ten million. Since the scandal became public the bank has paid one hundred and eighty-five million dollars in fines.\nNORAH O`DONNELL: USA Today reports that two California abortion opponents faced felony charges in an invasion of privacy case.

But May's decision means that Europe's three most powerful nations -- France, Germany and Britain -- will be convulsed by internal election campaigns as the clock ticks on the two-year deadline to complete Brexit negotiations.\nKey developments\nMPs must approve decision to dissolve Parliament part-way through full term. Vote will be held in Parliament on Wednesday. May had full support of Cabinet and had spoken to the Queen. Opposition parties say they will not block move to hold election on June 8. Theresa May likely to substantially increase her slim majority.\nMay, who commands only a slim majority in parliament's lower House of Commons, said that a new mandate would strengthen her hand in Brexit talks.\nA general election would end the attempts of opposition parties and members of the House of Lords to thwart her Brexit plans, she said. \"If we do not hold a general election now, their political game playing will continue,\" she told reporters at Downing Street.\n\"At this moment of enormous national significance, there should be unity here in Westminster, but instead there is division. The country is coming together, but Westminster is not,\" she added. \"We need a general election and we need one now.\"\nREAD: May's full speech\nHer decision is a sharp reversal of policy -- since taking over as Prime Minister, May had repeatedly ruled out an early election. May said she changed her mind on a recent walking holiday with her husband in Wales.\nIt is also a risky roll of the political dice. A fractious election campaign will reopen wounds barely healed after last year's EU referendum and give voice to those who oppose her strategy of pursuing a clean break from Europe.\nMay's Conservative Party currently holds 330 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons. She is expected to win an increased number -- opinion polls show support for the opposition Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, at record low levels.\nCorbyn said he would not oppose the call for an election. \"I welcome the Prime Minister's decision to give the British people the chance to vote for a government that will put the interests of the majority first,\" he said.\nUnder legislation introduced by the coalition government led her predecessor, David Cameron, an early election requires the support of two-thirds of MPs in the House of Commons. May said she would place a motion on Wednesday in the House of Commons calling for a vote on June 8.\nA Downing Street spokesman said that May had the full backing of her Cabinet on calling the election and that the Prime Minister had spoken with Queen Elizabeth II on Monday.\nCampaign begins\nMay called on voters to throw their support behind her Conservative Party, adding that \"every vote for the Conservatives will make me stronger\" in Brexit talks.\nCorbyn said he welcomed the decision to call for an election, even though his party is fractured over his leadership, widely regarded as lackluster.\nTim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats -- which was battered in the 2015 election and now holds just nine seats in the House of Commons -- said the election was Britain's chance to change direction.\nThe Liberal Democrats oppose Brexit, and Farron said he would push for as strong an association with Europe as possible -- a so-called \"soft\" Brexit -- including membership of the EU's free-trade zone, the single market.\nREAD: Market reaction, pound swings\nThe party said it had gained 1,000 new members in the hour after May's announcement. Labour also said it had gained 1,000 members Tuesday.\nIn Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is likely to use the campaign to pursue her demand for a fresh independence referendum, after Scotland overwhelmingly voted to stay in the European Union.\n\"This announcement is one of the most extraordinary U-turns in recent political history, and it shows that Theresa May is once again putting the interests of her party ahead of those of the country,\" Sturgeon said.\nBrexit talks loom\nBritain voted in July last year to leave the union after 44 years of membership in a divisive and hotly contested referendum.\nMay officially began the Brexit process on March 29 by triggering Article 50, the legal mechanism needed to begin the divorce process and officially start talks with the EU.\nThe negotiations are expected to be tough and will likely take place over two years, though the more complex aspects of Britain's future relationship with the EU, such as trade, could take even longer.\nMay has struggled with not only the opposition, but with members within her own Conservative Party, who have been at loggerheads over what kind of Brexit the country should have.\nThe Prime Minister laid out her vision for Brexit in January and more formally later with a White Paper. But even that basic framework -- which spelled out that Britain would leave the EU's single market -- caused divisions in her party and involved several rounds of deliberations before a coherent plan could be presented."}, {"id": "37", "title": "General election: UK Parliament approves Theresa May's snap vote", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/19/europe/uk-election-theresa-may/index.html", "time_stamp": "2017:4:19 00:00:00", "content": "Members of the British Parliament have approved Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to hold an early general election on June 8.\nMay made a unexpected announcement Tuesday that she would seek a \"snap\" election less than halfway through her government's five-year term, with the aim of gaining a stronger mandate for the country's historic withdrawal from the European Union.\nAfter debating the motion put forward by May in Parliament, 522 of the 650 sitting MPs voted in favor of the June 8 election, well and truly passing the threshold of two-thirds needed to approve the plan.\nThirteen voted against the motion.\nThe announcement marked a U-turn for May, who had repeatedly said she would not seek an early vote.\nThe snap vote is the latest twist in a turbulent year in British politics, which was plunged into turmoil when the country unexpectedly voted to leave the European Union last year. The hotly contested \"Brexit\" referendum ended with the resignation of then-Prime Minister David Cameron.\nREAD: May's full statement on election\nMay's Conservative Party holds a slim majority in Parliament's lower House of Commons and May is banking on gaining a greater share of the seats to make Brexit a smoother transition for her government.

But on Tuesday, she said she had \"reluctantly\" changed her mind because political divisions \"risk our ability to make a success of Brexit.\"\n\"We need a general election and we need one now,\" May said. \"Because we have, at this moment, a one-off chance to get this done, while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin.\"\nFor decades British prime ministers could call elections at will, but that changed with the 2011 Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which established set polling days every five years. Now, the prime minister needs the backing of two-thirds of lawmakers and May said she would put her election call to the House of Commons on Wednesday.\n\"Let us tomorrow vote for an election. Let us put forward our plans for Brexit and our alternative programs for government and then let the people decide,\" May said.\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, welcomed May's announcement, making it very likely she will get lawmakers' backing for an election.\nMay's governing Conservatives currently have a slight majority, with 330 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons.\nWith Labour demoralized and divided under left-wing leader Corbyn and the pro-EU Liberal Democrats holding just nine Commons seats, May is calculating that the election will bring her an expanded crop of Conservative lawmakers.\nThat would make it easier for her to ignore opposition calls for a softer EU exit - making compromises to retain some benefits of membership - and to face down hard-liners within her own party who want a no-compromise \"hard Brexit\" that many economists fear could be devastating.\nTim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said that even for a cautious politician like May, the temptation of an early election was irresistible.\n\"She has a small majority, a big task ahead of her and a huge opinion poll lead,\" he said. \"If you put all those things together they equal a general election.\"\nBale said a bigger majority would give May a new batch of loyal Conservative lawmakers and leave her less at the mercy of euroskeptics in her party \"who otherwise could have made negotiations much more difficult.\"\nMay triggered a two-year countdown to Britain's exit from the EU last month, and high-stakes negotiations to settle divorce terms and agree on a new relationship are expected to start within weeks.\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that he had a \"good phone call\" with May about the election, and the council said the bloc's Brexit plans were unchanged by the announcement. Leaders of EU states are due to adopt negotiating guidelines at an April 29 summit, and the bloc will prepare detailed plans for the talks with Britain by late May.\nLabour, the second-largest party in Parliament, campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU, but Corbyn said he would respect voters' decision to leave. He said Tuesday that Labour's election platform in June would be for a more equal society and economy, and \"a Brexit that works for all.\"\nPolls give May's Conservatives a double-digit lead over Labour, which could have its worst election showing in decades. But the election still carries risk for May, with voters' potentially wary at being asked to go to the polls again, less than a year after the EU referendum.\n\"I think actually it makes her look a little bit arrogant and a little bit complacent,\" said Liberal Democrat lawmaker Alistair Carmichael. \"She's taking people for granted already and voters never like that.\"\nThe strongly pro-EU Liberal Democrats have seen thousands of new members join since the referendum and are likely to make gains. Leader Tim Farron said Tuesday that only his party can prevent a \"disastrous hard Brexit.\"\nRather than helping the country unite, the election could widen divisions within the United Kingdom. The U.K. voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the EU, but Scotland backed remaining by a large majority, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is seeking to hold a referendum on independence from the U.K.\nSturgeon said Tuesday that May was seeking \"to crush the voices of people who disagree with her.\"\nIt was \"all the more important,\" she said, \"that Scotland is protected from a Tory (Conservative) Party which now sees the chance of grabbing control of government for many years to come and moving the U.K. further to the right - forcing through a hard Brexit and imposing deeper cuts in the process.\"\nThe Scottish National Party currently holds 54 of Scotland's 59 seats in the British Parliament, making it the third-largest party there.\nStill, currency markets welcomed May's announcement as a harbinger of greater stability. The pound surged 0.7 percent against the dollar to $1.2658, recovering from a 0.4 percent drop an hour earlier as rumors swirled about the surprise statement.\n___"}, {"id": "109", "title": "The Latest: UK lawmakers overwhelmingly back June election", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://apnews.com/d426fe2281d74a4ba767c8ba66583eaf", "time_stamp": "2017:4:19 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - The Latest on the British prime minister's decision to seek an early election (all times local):\n2:45 p.m.\nBritish lawmakers have voted by a resounding 522 to 13 to back Prime Minister Theresa May's call for a national election on June 8.\nThe result easily surpasses the two-thirds majority of the 650 lawmakers needed to trigger an early vote.

A national election in May 2015 was followed by the June 2016 referendum on EU membership.\nShe said the early ballot would strengthen Britain's negotiating hand with the 27-member EU.\n\"Brexit isn't just about the letter that says we want to leave. It's about ... getting the right deal from Europe,\" May said.\nEU officials say Britain's surprise election will not interrupt the bloc's preparations for Brexit talks - though they will slightly delay the start of negotiations.\nLeaders of EU states are due to adopt negotiating guidelines at an April 29 summit, and the bloc will prepare detailed plans for the talks with Britain by late May.\nIt had been hoped talks could start by the end of that month, but EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said Wednesday that \"the real political negotiations\" with Britain would not start till after the June 8 election.\nMay ruled out participating in televised debates with other leaders. TV debates don't have a long history in British politics, but were a feature of the last two elections, in 2010 and 2015.\n\"We won't be doing television debates,\" May said, adding that politicians should spend election campaigns \"out and about\" meeting voters.\nOne broadcaster, ITV, said it planned to hold a debate with or without the prime minister.\nLiberal Democrat leader Farron said that broadcasters should hold debates anyway, with an empty chair in May's place.\n\"The prime minister's attempt to dodge scrutiny shows how she holds the public in contempt,\" he said.\n___"}], "31": [{"id": "38", "title": "UK's Labour Party vows to ditch Theresa May's Brexit plan if elected", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/europe/brexit-uk-labour-party/index.html", "time_stamp": "2017:4:25 00:00:00", "content": "Britain's main opposition party has vowed to scrap Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans if it wins the general election in June, saying it will seek a softer departure from the European Union.\nLabour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said that, if elected, his party would guarantee EU nationals living Britain the right to remain in the UK after the split, and would be open to retaining the benefits of the EU's single market and customs union.\nLaying out his party's vision for Brexit in London on Tuesday, Starmer sought to offer British voters a clear alternative to May's plans for a \"hard Bexit.\"\nMay has said that she favors a clean break -- leaving the single market and removing the UK from the obligation to allow unlimited migration from the EU, known as \"freedom of movement.\"\nBut Starmer said that May's Brexit vision was \"reckless\" and that the June 8 election was fundamentally a vote on what kind of Brexit the British people wanted.\n\"We do not accept that Brexit has to mean whatever Theresa May says it means.

But a bruising election campaign has dented her steely reputation.\nBritain's 60-year-old prime minister called a snap election - three years early - for this Thursday in a bid to increase her party's slim majority in Parliament and strengthen her hand in divorce negotiations with the European Union.\nIt looked like a clever, confident move by a leader whose party was as much as 20 points ahead of the Labour Party opposition in opinion polls.\nBut after a campaign scarred by two deadly attacks in Britain, lackluster media appearances and misjudged policy announcements, it looks to some like evidence of hubris and political shortsightedness.\nMay was first elected to Parliament in 1997, and soon established a reputation for unflashy competence and a knack for vanquishing her rivals.\nIn 2002, she warned Conservatives that many voters saw them as the \"nasty party.\" Unlike the arch free-marketeer Thatcher, May often speaks of giving the poor a helping hand and lifting barriers to social mobility.\nWhile Thatcher was a groundbreaking woman who disparaged feminism, May helped set up Women2Win, a group that aims to bring more women into Parliament.\nMay's sense of social responsibility was nourished by her upbringing as the child of a rural Anglican vicar. In contrast to predecessor David Cameron, who was the wealthy product of elite private schools, she represents what's often called \"middle England\" - middle-class, middlebrow in taste, middle-of-the-road in politics.\nShe enjoys cooking and walking in the mountains with her husband Philip, whom she met at Oxford University. Her only touches of flamboyance are fondness for bold outfits and brightly patterned kitten-heel shoes.\nWhen Cameron became prime minister in 2010, he made May home secretary, and she held the post for six years - an unusually long time in a notoriously thankless job, responsible for borders, immigration and law and order.\nShe wasn't afraid to make herself unpopular. In 2012, she was booed at a police convention over cuts to forces' budgets. Those cuts came back to haunt May after a bomber killed 22 people in Manchester on May 22, leaving her open to accusations of weakening the country's security. Allegations that May had compromised national security grew louder after three attackers killed seven people in the London Bridge area less than a week before the vote.\nMay became prime minister partly by skill and partly by luck. She emerged victorious from a bitter and chaotic Conservative Party leadership contest after Britain's June 2016 decision to leave the European Union. May had backed the losing \"remain\" side in the referendum, but promised as leader to respect voters' will: \"Brexit means Brexit,\" she said.\nWith her determination and self-belief, May was able to unite the fractious Conservative Party, split between mutually hostile pro-EU and anti-EU wings.\nBut the party's unity now looks fragile.\nAn election campaign built around May's stature has exposed her flaws. She often appears stiff and has relied almost robotically on catchphrases like \"strong and stable government\" for her time in office, and \"coalition of chaos\" when referring to her rival, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Her refusal to take part in television debates has led to allegations that she is running scared.\nThe Conservative Party's election manifesto, which carries May's imprimatur, has been accused of offering voters all stick and no carrot. It contained electorally damaging plans to cut benefits to pensioners and change the way they pay for long-term care. Opponents dubbed that a \"dementia tax,\" and the label has stuck."}], "32": [{"id": "39", "title": "How Theresa May's 'Brexit election' strategy backfired", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/09/world/uk-election-theresa-may-brexit-strategy-backfired/index.html", "time_stamp": "2017:6:9 00:00:00", "content": "It was supposed to be the Brexit Election. When Theresa May announced back in April she was calling a risky snap election, three years before it was necessary, she invited British voters to increase her Conservative government's majority and give her the strengthened mandate she needed to go into Brexit talks and get a good deal for the country.\nIt was a battle between what she defined her \"strong and stable\" leadership and a \"coalition of chaos\" under her opponent, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nIn the end, it was the Brexit Election -- just not in the way everyone predicted. Having pledged to be the strong Prime Minister fighting for Britain in the negotiating room in Brussels, May appears to have lost her majority because of voters rejected the type of Brexit she had proposed.\nMay had set out a plan for a \"hard Brexit\", with Britain severing almost all ties with the European Union. Instead, voters preferred the \"softer Brexit\" proposed by Labour under Jeremy Corbyn, or the \"no Brexit\" line touted by the Liberal Democrats, still fighting the cause for Remain.\nWith most results in, Labour has picked up the support of two crucial groups of voters: Leave supporters in the north of England who at the 2015 election had backed the anti-EU party Ukip, and Remain voters in the south of England who switched from both Conservatives apparently in protest at Brexit.\nBrexit talks delayed?\nThe result means Brexit talks are now in danger of being delayed. Formal negotiations are set to start in just 10 days, on June 19. But with uncertainty about who the Prime Minister will be over the next few days, it is possible that the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, will announce a delay.\nThis is likely to cause further uncertainty to sterling markets, after an initial fall in the pound late on Thursday when the exit poll suggesting a hung parliament was first released.\nIf coalition talks are not resolved within days, this looks like a likely option. If the election is a stalemate and no one can form a majority government, it is possible there will be another general election in the fall.\nDisaster for May\nThe result is a personal disaster for May, who staked her authority on the election and looks to have thrown away the first Conservative majority for 18 years after just two years. It looks like she can only remain in power by relying on the support of the Northern Ireland DUP, the UUP or both. Conservative MPs, furious at being forced into an early and unnecessary campaign for nothing, will start demanding she steps down.\nMay looked shattered when she appeared at the declaration of her own constituency result in Maidenhead just after 3am. \"At this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability,\" she said, her voice faltering, suggesting she intends to cling on.\nBut Conservative MPs will find this statement extraordinary given she repeated the mantra \"strong and stable\" throughout the campaign and the result has ended up in huge uncertainty, instability and a falling pound. It is possible there will be a challenge to her leadership as soon as Friday or over the weekend, with Brexit supporting MPs like Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, tipped as potential challengers.\nLabour's success\nWhile it's important to remember Labour have not won this election, or even ended up as the largest party, the party's achievement is considerable. There is more than Brexit at play, however. A month ago, Labour had one of its worst ever performances in the local elections, pointing to disaster for Corbyn in Thursday's general election. But since those local elections, the Labour and Conservative manifestoes changed everything.\nCorbyn's manifesto was an array of left-wing populist policies: higher taxes, but more money for the NHS, schools and university students, renationalization of some key industries. The polls suggested voters liked what they saw.\nThe Conservative manifesto, by contrast, marked a turning point: it included a shake up in funding for elderly care, which opponents branded a \"dementia tax\", a label which stuck and May had to hastily announce tweaks to the policy in the face of a backlash.\nTwo terrorist attacks, in Manchester on May 23 and in London on June 3, provoked a debate about national security. This should have benefited May, a former Home Secretary who was tough on law and order, and damaged Corbyn, who has voiced support in the past for the IRA and Hamas. Yet May faced accusations of cuts to police officers during her time as Home Secretary and Corbyn's rating did not seem to suffer on this issue.\nYouth vote\nAnother factor that was crucial in Labour's surge was the youth vote. At the local elections, young people were less likely to turn out and voting among this age group is generally lower in elections than older voters.\nOn Thursday, there were signs that the 18-24 age group had turned up to back Corbyn: including in university areas like Sheffield Hallam, where former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, a Liberal Democrat lost his seat to Labour.\nThere was more exposure to the voters of Corbyn, through TV debates, which will have boosted the Labour leader. There will be comparisons to Donald Trump, with Corbyn an anti-establishment outsider with a populist agenda -- albeit from a left-wing platform.\nThe losses for the Conservatives would have been worse were it not for an extraordinary surge for May's party in Scotland, where the Scottish National Party, who were dominant in 2015, winning 56 seats out of 59, saw seats fall."}, {"id": "79", "title": "British PM Vows to Form Government After Election Humiliation", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "YOUTUBE", "time_stamp": "2017:6:9 00:00:00", "content": "The prime minister said her new government will provide safety and security for the U.K. and \"no one will be left behind\" during upcoming Brexit negotiations with the European Union.\nClick to view video\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/video/u-k-election-2017-british-pm-theresa-may-says-she-will-form-government-963783235985"}, {"id": "80", "title": "UK Election: PM May Embarrased, but Remains in Power - For Now", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/uk-election-pm-may-embarrased-but-remains-in-power-for-now-964245571742", "time_stamp": "2017:6:9 00:00:00", "content": "When PM Theresa May recently called snap elections, she hoped for a landslide.

After Britain's June 23, 2016 referendum to leave the bloc, the other 27 nations wanted to start the exit talks as soon as possible so they could work on their own futures, but Britain long seemed dazed by its own momentous move.\nAnd even when May finally triggered the two-year unraveling process on March 29, she followed it up by calling an early election on June 8 that she hoped would strengthen her majority in parliament and thus her negotiating mandate with the EU.\nThe move backfired, May lost her Conservative majority in the vote and has been fending off critics of her leadership ever since.\nStill, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson remained upbeat Monday, saying he thinks the Brexit negotiations will yield \"a happy resolution that can be done with profit and honor for both sides.\"\nJohnson also urged Europeans to look further down the road."}], "34": [{"id": "43", "title": "Brexit could end with no deal -- but no one wants to admit it", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/opinions/brexit-no-deal-carole-walker-opinion/index.html", "time_stamp": "2017:9:8 00:00:00", "content": "It's been more than five months since the formal start of negotiations over Britain's departure from the EU -- and progress so far has been painfully slow.\nBoth sides admit there are significant differences to be overcome and are locked in a standoff over the structure of the talks.\nNeither the UK nor the EU wants to talk about what will happen if there is no deal, but some British Members of Parliament believe it is time for the government to start talking seriously about what would happen in this scenario.\nThe UK's chief Brexit negotiator, David Davis, insists that \"concrete progress\" has been made. He has received assurances on healthcare rights for British citizens living in the EU and on arrangements for sharing data. But he has admitted the talks are \"tough and at times confrontational.\"\nHis EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, has said there has been \"no decisive progress on any of the principle subjects\" and he is \"disappointed\" at the British approach. He is insisting that there must be sufficient progress on the the issue of whether or not there will be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the rights of EU citizens in the UK and the Brexit bill before any discussion of a future trade deal.\nDavis says such matters can only be decided as part of the discussions on the post-Brexit relationship. He points out it is impossible to resolve questions such as the Irish border without considering future customs arrangements.\nAt next month's summit in Brussels, the EU is due to declare whether there is sufficient progress on what it calls \"separation issues\" to begin talking about post-Brexit trade.\nBut senior figures in the European Parliament are already suggesting the assessment should be delayed until December.\nSources close to the talks have suggested Prime Minister Theresa May could use the occasion to appeal directly to EU leaders to try to break the stalemate. But the remaining 27 EU states are clearly reluctant to unpick their carefully negotiated joint approach to the talks.\nThe EU does have a tradition of somehow finding a compromise at the eleventh -- or even the thirteenth -- hour, and it is in the interests of both sides to reach a deal. But we are constantly reminded that the clock is ticking and the gulf between the two sides on so many critical issues remains as deep as ever.\nBoth sides want a transition period so there is no \"cliff-edge\" for businesses and citizens. But that will only happen if there is at least an outline agreement on where that transition will lead.\nWithout a deal, the UK would suddenly find itself in the same position as any other non-EU country which does not have special arrangements in place with the EU. It would suddenly operate under World Trade Organization rules, which would mean tariffs and restrictions on trade with its biggest economic partner. And there would almost certainly be big problems at the borders.\nThere are real risks for the British government in talking up the prospect of leaving without a deal. It would face accusations of a disastrous failure. Businesses would warn of serious consequences and the pound would probably dive still further. Theresa May could struggle to retain her already precarious hold on power.\nBut if the negotiations continue at the snail's pace which we have seen over the past five months, we will reach a point when it becomes clear that an agreement is unlikely to be reached in time to achieve the smooth transition which the UK government is seeking.\nIf it has laid the ground for such a scenario, it is just possible that it may be able to contain the fallout. It could set out contingency plans, talk up the prospects of global free trade deals and lay the blame firmly at the door of an intransigent EU.\nBritish ministers may need to demonstrate that they are seriously prepared to walk away without agreement if they are to win any real concessions from the EU."}, {"id": "103", "title": "UK's Labour backs staying in EU's single market after Brexit", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/uks-labour-backs-staying-in-eus-single-market-after-brexit", "time_stamp": "2017:8:27 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - Britain's main opposition party announced Sunday that it backs the U.K. staying in the European Union's single market and customs union during a \"transition period\" after Brexit, arguing that would give much-needed certainty to businesses and consumers.\nThe Labour Party says the ruling Conservative Party's Brexit position - taking Britain out of the EU single market immediately after March 2019, when Britain formally leaves the bloc - would be \"unnecessary\" and \"a highly risky path to take.\"\nLabour Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said his party wants Britain to keep abiding by the terms of its current EU membership during a transition period before a final shift to a new Britain-EU relationship.

A third member of the government, Steve Baker, a junior minister in Davis' Department for Exiting the European Union, also resigned.\nOnly three days ago, May appeared to have agreed on a deal with her fractured Cabinet on the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. That plan is now in tatters and her political future appears uncertain.\nIn his resignation letter, Johnson savaged May's strategy, accusing her of allowing an optimistic Brexit vision to become clouded by a failure of ambition. In what amounted to a declaration of political war, Johnson said May's vision of a close future relationship with the EU would confine the UK to a \"status of colony\" and amounted merely to a \"semi-Brexit.\"\nThe Prime Minister said she was \"sorry and a little surprised\" over Johnson's resignation, after \"productive discussions\" on Friday.\n\"As we developed our policy on Brexit, I have allowed Cabinet colleagues considerable latitude to express their views,\" she said in her letter of response to him. \"But the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case, and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down.\"\nMay appeared in Parliament earlier on Monday afternoon to defend her plan, minutes after Downing Street confirmed the departure of Johnson. In her statement to members of Parliament, May acknowledged the splits in her government and the departures of her ministers. \"We do not agree about the best way of delivering our shared commitment to honoring the result of the referendum.\"\nMay acted quickly to replace the ministers. Dominic Raab, the former minister of state for housing and planning, was named the new Brexit secretary. He pledged to secure the \"best deal with our EU friends and partners\" for the UK. He also said he will \"step up the preparations for 'no deal' in case the spirit of pragmatism and compromise that we have extended is not reciprocated.\"\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt was named the new UK foreign secretary on Monday, according to a tweet from 10 Downing Street. A longtime ally of May, he campaigned for remain but now says he supports Brexit.\nHow we got here\nThe Prime Minister's latest political drama began late on Sunday night when Davis announced his decision to leave his post, declaring he could not support May's plan for Brexit agreed plan. The agreement involved too close a relationship with the EU, he said, and gave only an illusion of control being returned to the UK after it left the bloc.\n\"It seems to me we're giving too much away, too easily, and that's a dangerous strategy at this time,\" Davis said in a BBC radio interview Monday morning.\nJohnson's resignation was more perilous for May given his seniority in government. It came Monday afternoon, just before the Prime Minister was due to make a scheduled statement in Parliament.\nThe value of the British pound dropped on international markets after Johnson's announcement, having risen after the announcement Friday that a Cabinet deal on Brexit had been agreed.\nThe decision by Johnson, a former mayor of London, to back Brexit, was seen as crucial when the issue was taken to a referendum two years ago. He became a leading figure in the \"Leave\" campaign, painting a rosy picture of Britain's future outside the European Union.\nBut as Foreign Secretary in May's government, he was prone to gaffes and criticized for not being on top of his brief.\nOpposition politicians were quick to capitalize on May's troubles.\n\"This mess is all of the Prime Ministers own making,\" opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn told lawmakers. \"Two secretaries of state have resigned and still we are no clearer as to what our future relationship with our nearest neighbors and biggest trading partners will be.\"\nIn her statement to Parliament, May attempted to give an impression of business as usual. She said she would present a detailed paper on Thursday on the government's negotiating position for a post-Brexit relationship with the EU.\nBut in reality, she will be at the mercy of her party. Leading proponents of Brexit called on her to abandon the deal struck with the Cabinet last Friday at Chequers, her country retreat outside London.\nJacob Rees-Mogg, who leads a bloc of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs in Parliament, urged May to give up on the plan. \"What the Prime Minister needs to do is to give up on the Chequers proposal ... which does not actually deliver Brexit,\" he told LBC Radio.\nIf she refuses to change course, she could face a leadership challenge. Under Conservative Party rules, a leadership race could be triggered if at least 48 of her MPs declared their support for one. There was feverish speculation on Monday about May's prospects.\nLong before the Brexit referendum and its aftermath, the Conservative Party was split on Europe, and May has struggled to unite the warring wings under her leadership.\nAn attempt to enlarge her parliamentary majority with a snap election -- that would have allowed her to sideline euroskeptic Conservatives and pursue her own vision of Brexit -- ended in embarrassing failure."}, {"id": "82", "title": "In blow to Theresa May, UK's top Brexit official quits government", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/most-senior-brexit-official-quits-government-british-media-report-n889726", "time_stamp": "2018:7:9 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/most-senior-brexit-official-quits-government-british-media-report-n889726\nThe resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis undermined Prime Minister Theresa May's already fragile government.\nClick to view image\nhttp://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2018_27/2490941/180708-brexit-secretary-david-davis-se-753p_aa6a30c2e47633d0c7570a723e89cf1f.jpg\nDaniel Leal-Olivas\nImage: Britain's Brexit Minister David Davis"}, {"id": "83", "title": "British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson quits as Brexit crisis deepens", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/theresa-may-rocked-brexit-resignations-faces-potential-challenge-power-n889781", "time_stamp": "2018:7:9 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/theresa-may-rocked-brexit-resignations-faces-potential-challenge-power-n889781\nDays before President Trump is due to visit, British PM May faces a threat to her future\nClick to view image\nhttp://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2018_28/2491121/180709-david-davies-mc-1122_2d6079d84b263e15e7824dc7899b347c.JPG\nADRIAN DENNIS\nImage: David Davis"}, {"id": "169", "title": "British minister resigns over 'soft Brexit' plan", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/britains-brexit-secretary-suddenly-resigns/2018/07/08/ede55e46-8306-11e8-9e06-4db52ac42e05_story.html", "time_stamp": "2018:7:9 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON - Prime Minister Theresa May's government was thrown into turmoil late Sunday with the surprise resignation of David Davis, her \"Brexit minister\" in charge of negotiating Britain's exit from the European Union.\nThe midnight resignation came as a shock to British politics, exposing May to challenge by Conservative Party members outraged over what they see as her plan to secure a \"soft Brexit\" that keeps Britain tied to many rules and regulations of the European Union after it leaves the bloc next year.\nHard-line Brexit backers, who argue that May should have a clean, decisive break from Brussels, spent the weekend complaining that her recently revealed proposals were a timid capitulation, a \"Brexit in name only\" that ignored \"the will of the people\" who voted 52 percent-to-48 percent in June 2016 to leave the European bloc.\nBefore his letter of resignation was made public, Davis's allies told the British press that he was resigning because he could not support the soft Brexit plan pushed forward Friday by May at a crunch cabinet meeting at the prime minister's countryside estate, called Chequers.\nIn that meeting, May had appeared to win over her fractious cabinet and secure approval for her plan, which was to be published as soon as this week in a lengthy white paper that would stake out Britain's vision for future relations with Europe.\nWhile May's plan for exiting the European Union has not been fully revealed to all members of her party - let alone to Parliament, the business community or the public - the brief outline that was released shows she supports a middle way of compromise with Brussels, keeping Britain closely aligned with Europe on standards, \"a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products.\" This, her critics charged, would shackle Britain and make it a rule taker but not a rulemaker.\nMay was scheduled to address all Tory parliamentarians at a meeting Monday night.\nNow some Conservatives who are pushing for a hard Brexit threaten that the prime minister could face a no-confidence vote soon.\nThe British political press said more resignations may be coming.\nReaction came thick and fast early Monday - for those who were awake.\nSome Brexit backers cheered Davis on. \n\"Fantastic news,\" tweeted Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative lawmaker. \"Well done David Davis for having the principal and guts to resign.

May is politically vulnerable because of Brexit, analysts say, and Trump's comments drove nonstop headlines questioning her policy.\nHis comments to the Sun led to a furor in London, and he eventually seemed to backtrack, saying he would support May no matter what she did.\n\"Interestingly, what the president also said at that news conference was 'Don't walk away,' \" May told the BBC.\n\" 'Don't walk away from those negotiations because then you'll be stuck.'

But the remarks by Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, exposed the deep chasm that remains between the two sides on certain key sticking points such as the Irish border.\nIn a brief statement in Salzburg on Wednesday, Tusk said that while proposals hashed out by May and her Cabinet at her Chequers country retreat are a \"positive evolution,\" the issues surrounding the Irish border and economic cooperation need to be \"reworked and further negotiated.\"\nIf a deal can't be reached, Britain risks crashing out of the EU at the end of March next year in a messy fashion. The Bank of England has warned that house prices would crash, businesses fret over chaos at the Channel ports and airlines worry that the agreements that keep planes in the air across Europe would fall away.\nBut for a deal to be concluded, each side must find a way of avoiding the necessity to rebuild border posts between Northern Ireland, which will leave the EU with the rest of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU.

But he also demanded that she abandon her Chequers plan.\nMeanwhile, \"Remain\" supporters have been rallying behind a burgeoning campaign for a new referendum, known as a \"people's vote.\"\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, a vocal Brexit opponent, warned May's statement moved the country \"another step closer to the worst possible outcome from the Brexit negotiations -- a catastrophic 'no deal' that would hammer jobs and economic growth.\""}, {"id": "172", "title": "May asks for a little respect in Brexit talks", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/theresa-may-asks-for-a-little-respect-from-europe-in-brexit-talks/2018/09/21/b2a60b9a-bd9f-11e8-8243-f3ae9c99658a_story.html", "time_stamp": "2018:9:23 00:00:00", "content": "After strained meeting in Salzburg, she declares an impasse with E.U.\nLONDON - After being confronted, even mocked a bit, at a meeting of European leaders in Austria this week, Prime Minister Theresa May told her country on Friday that \"we are at an impasse\" in negotiations over Britain's departure from the continental union.\nMay has struggled to put forward a complex compromise that can win signatures in Europe and be accepted by rebellious hard-liners in her own government ahead of the March 29 Brexit deadline.\nIn a curt address from 10 Downing Street, carried live on Friday, May said Europe was asking for more concessions than she could grant.\n\"No one wants a good deal more than me,\" she said. \"But the E.U. should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country.\"\nMay conceded that the two sides remain far apart - and threatened that Britain could leave the union without a deal, a scenario that many British businesses consider a doomsday option.\nIn Salzburg, May was told quite plainly by her counterparts that her proposals on Brexit \"will not work.\" French President Emmanuel Macron went further and called Brexit campaigners liars for telling voters that leaving the European Union would be both easy and profitable.\nMay was allowed to make her case to the 27 other European leaders in a Wednesday dinner speech - but was then excluded from their talks on Brexit the next morning.\nWhile still at the meeting, in a gesture that many Brits saw as insulting, European Council President Donald Tusk posted a photo on Instagram of himself offering May a pastry - with the caption: \"A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.\"\nThe joke being that Britain's strategy for leaving the European Union's single market has been unrealistic. As former British foreign secretary Boris Johnson put it: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\nTusk was also tsk-tsking May for trying to \"cherry-pick\" a trade deal with Europe - wanting to maintain a common \"rule book\" for the frictionless trade of goods, for example, while going a separate way on services.\nMay was clearly miffed at her treatment. \n\"Throughout this process, I have treated the E.U. with nothing but respect. The U.K. expects the same,\" she said.\nMay also complained that the Europeans were being obstinate.\n\"At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counterproposals,\" she said.\nIn the past, European negotiators have said it is Britain that is being unrealistic and not paying attention. In Britain, the political class is obsessed with Brexit. In Europe, leaders have moved on.\nBritish opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called May's Brexit strategy \"a disaster\" and said \"the political games from both the E.U. and our government need to end because no deal is not an option.\"\nNicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, called May's remarks \"dreadful.\"\n\"The E.U. view was bluntly expressed yesterday but not new - she just hasn't been listening,\" Sturgeon said, adding that May's proposals were a \"dead duck\" and that the British prime minister shouldn't be blaming the European Union for the impasse.\nTusk responded to May's remarks by stating that \"the U.K. stance presented just before and during the Salzburg meeting was surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising.\" He added that the 27 remaining members of the European Union were unified and that May's proposals on economic cooperation and the Irish border \"need to be reworked and further negotiated.\""}], "46": [{"id": "54", "title": "Defiant Theresa May rebuilds shattered government as Brexit crisis eases", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/16/uk/brexit-theresa-may-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2018:11:16 00:00:00", "content": "The beleaguered British Prime Minister Theresa May began to rebuild her splintered government Friday, replacing two Cabinet ministers who quit over her troubled Brexit plans and facing down demands that she resign.\nAfter a rollercoaster week that threatened to bring an end to her premiership, May survived Friday without any further high-profile departures from her administration. To the relief of Downing Street, key Brexit-supporting ministers said they would stay on.\nCrucially, May won the support of Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer who was said to have been on the verge of quitting. \"I am looking forward to continuing to work with all colleagues in government and in Parliament to get the best future for Britain,\" he told reporters mid-morning.\nAnother Brexit-supporting minister, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, told CNN he would stay in the Cabinet, and urged fellow Conservative Party lawmakers to support May. \"I think that we have to wait until we conclude this process,\" he said. \"I think the Prime Minister deserves the right to put that case to the European Union. I think that the greatest price that could be paid would be to have no Brexit at all.\"\nIn a sign of May's weakness, however, she did not deny reports that Gove had snubbed an offer to take up the post of Brexit Secretary, vacated by Dominic Raab in the most significant of Thursday's bombshell resignations. \"I had a very good conversation with Michael yesterday,\" she told LBC Radio.\nThe specter of a confidence vote still looms over May. A total of 21 Conservative MPs have publicly demanded she step aside, short of the 48 required under party rules to trigger a vote. But more may have made their views known in private to party officials.\nIf a confidence vote is called, it could take place within a matter of days. If May lost, she would be forced to step down as Prime Minister and Britain's political crisis would get considerably more intense. But if May wins, Conservative Party rules prevent another challenge for a year.\nIn an attempt to shore up her government, May picked a key ally, Amber Rudd, to replace Esther McVey as Work and Pensions Secretary. Soon after, she appointed Stephen Barclay, formerly a health minister, as Brexit Secretary.\nRudd had resigned as Home Secretary in April after admitting she \"inadvertently misled\" MPs over deportation targets. A parliamentary report later ruled Rudd had been poorly served by officials.\nShe urged rebel-minded Conservative MPs to support May. \"This is not a time for changing our leader,\" Rudd said in a pooled broadcast interview. \"This is a time for pulling together, for making sure we remember who we are here to serve, who we are here to help -- that's the whole of the country.\"\nBarclay, a Brexit-supporting junior health minister who has never served in the Cabinet before, is a loyalist who has not once voted against the government in parliament. His influence on Brexit negotiations is likely to be limited, as Downing Street announced that it will take the lead in further discussions with the European Union. Barclay will focus instead on getting Britain ready for leaving the European Union on March 29 next year.\nIt was unclear whether May's opponents within her party would muster enough support over the weekend to force a confidence vote. Conservative Party chief whip Julian Smith -- whose role is to maintain party discipline -- was seen arriving at Downing Street on Friday morning as May seeks to rally support within Conservative ranks.\nAppearing on the LBC phone-in Friday morning, May maintained a defiant stance as she sought to sell her Brexit plan.\nAsked why she believed she should stay on rather than standing aside to let a Brexiteer lead, she replied: \"You're absolutely right that for a lot of people who voted Leave, what they wanted to do was make sure that decisions on things like who can come into this country would be taken by us here in the UK, and not by Brussels, and that's exactly what the deal I've negotiated delivers.\"\nEven if she survives a challenge to her leadership, May must still win approval for her deal from the UK Parliament -- where she lacks a working majority. Few commentators think she has the votes to get her deal through, but all predictions about May's capacity for survival have been wrong so far."}, {"id": "126", "title": "British Prime Minister Theresa May says Cabinet agrees draft Brexit deal with European Union after 'impassioned' debate", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.seattletimes.com/business/british-prime-minister-theresa-may-says-cabinet-agrees-draft-brexit-deal-with-european-union-after-impassioned-debate/", "time_stamp": "2018:11:14 00:00:00", "content": ""}, {"id": "134", "title": "May wins Cabinet backing for Brexit deal but pitfalls remain", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.apnews.com/4179680916a64b08a3afa24ea50785a4", "time_stamp": "2018:11:14 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - In a hard-won victory, British Prime Minister Theresa May persuaded her fractious Cabinet to back a draft divorce agreement with the European Union on Thursday, a decision that triggers the final steps on the long and rocky road to Brexit.\nBut she faces a backlash from her many political opponents and a fierce battle to get the deal through Parliament as she tries to orchestrate the U.K.'s orderly exit from the EU.\nMay hailed the Cabinet decision as a \"decisive step\" toward finalizing the exit deal with the EU within days. It sets in motion an elaborate diplomatic choreography of statements and meetings.\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier declared there had been \"decisive progress\" - the key phrase signaling EU leaders can convene a summit to approve the deal, probably later his month.\nCrucially, Barnier said that \"we have now found a solution together with the U.K. to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\"\nBut the agreement, hammered out between U.K. and EU negotiators after 17 months of what Barnier called \"very intensive\" talks, infuriated pro-Brexit lawmakers in May's Conservative Party, who said it would leave Britain a vassal state, bound to EU rules that it has no say in making.\nThose \"hard Brexit\" voices include several ministers in May's Cabinet. Emerging from the five-hour meeting at 10 Downing St., May said the Cabinet talks had been \"long, detailed and impassioned.\" She said there had been a \"collective decision\" to back the deal, though she did not say whether it was unanimous.\n\"I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom,\" she said.\nIn a warning to her opponents, May said the choice was between her deal, \"or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\"\nIf the EU backs the deal, as it likely will, it must be approved by Britain's Parliament. That could be a challenge, since pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it.\nPro-Brexit lawmakers say the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs and unable to forge an independent trade policy.\nOn the other side of the argument, pro-EU legislators say May's deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\nIn between those two camps are May's supporters, who argue that the deal is the best on offer, and the alternatives are a chaotic \"no-deal\" Brexit that would cause huge disruption to people and businesses, or an election that could see the Conservative government replaced by the left-of-center Labour Party.\nFailure to secure Cabinet backing would have left May's leadership in doubt and the Brexit process in chaos, with exit day just over four months away, on March 29.\nShe still faces the threat of a coup attempt from her own party.\nUnder Conservative rules, a no-confidence vote in the leader is triggered if 15 percent of party lawmakers write letters requesting one. The required number currently stands at 48 lawmakers; only the lawmaker who collects the letters knows for sure how many have been submitted.\nPro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker Conor Burns said he wanted a change of policy rather than a new leader, but added: \"There comes a point where if the PM is insistent that she will not change the policy, then the only way to change the policy is to change the personnel.\"\nThe main obstacle to a withdrawal agreement has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland's hard-won peace process.\nThe solution in the agreement involves a \"single EU-U.K. customs territory,\" to eliminate the need for border checks.\nAs part of the agreement, the U.K. will agree to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental standards and workplace protections - another source of anger for Brexiteers, who say Britain should be free to set its own rules.\nThe solution is intended to be temporary - superseded by a permanent trade deal. But pro-Brexit politicians in Britain fear it may become permanent, hampering Britain's ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\nLeading Euroskeptic Conservative legislator Jacob Rees-Mogg urged his colleagues to vote against the deal, saying it \"will lock us into an EU customs union and EU laws. This will prevent us pursuing a U.K. trade policy based around our priorities and economy.\"\nThe draft agreement also mentions potential \"Northern Ireland-specific regulatory alignment\" to avoid a hard border.\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, insists it will oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\"We could not as unionists support a deal that broke up the United Kingdom,\" DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n___"}, {"id": "173", "title": "Theresa May gets cabinet backing for draft Brexit plan", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/theresa-may-faces-crunch-cabinet-showdown-over-her-brexit-plans/2018/11/14/124a425a-e807-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "time_stamp": "2018:11:15 00:00:00", "content": "The blueprint still must clear European Union and British Parliament\nLONDON - After a five-hour meeting with her cabinet, and months of struggle and delay, Prime Minister Theresa May emerged from 10 Downing Street on Wednesday and announced that her ministers had approved her Brexit plan.\nThe draft agreement, negotiated by British and European Union officials, is a decisive step toward finalizing Britain's departure from the European Union in March.\nThe agreement, which has been compared to the world's most complex divorce settlement, lays out the billions of euros that Britain will pay to leave, what rights Europeans living in Britain will have after Brexit, and how a 21-month transition period will work. The agreement also promises a solution to the knotty challenge of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Irish Republic, which will remain in the E.U.\nThe plan still requires endorsement by European leaders this month, which should be relatively easy, to be followed by a far more difficult vote in December in the British Parliament, where many members decry the draft deal as a weak capitulation that satisfies no one.\nThe cabinet approval of May's package marked the end of a remarkable 24 hours in British politics - a true cliffhanger, with social media and the airwaves filled with speculation about whether the deal, and May herself, would survive.\nEven as May prepared to speak, British political reporters were tweeting that a challenge to her leadership might be underway.\nThe prime minister looked exhausted as she faced the cameras Wednesday evening outside her official residence. Rather than celebrate a hard-won round in her fight for a workable Brexit deal, she sounded somber.\n\"This is a decision that will come under intense scrutiny, but the decision was to build a future for our country or to go back to square one and fail on the promise of the referendum,\" May said, without elaborating on the details of the deal.\nShe described a \"long, detailed and impassioned debate\" within her cabinet, whose ranks are balanced between those who, like May, voted against Brexit two years ago, and those who campaigned hard for it - ministers such as Michael Gove and Liam Fox, who are committed Brexiteers.\nMay said the Brexit withdrawal agreement will protect jobs and preserve the United Kingdom. She did not say that it would make Britain great again.\n\"I firmly believe with my head and my heart that this is a decision that is in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom,\" May said.\nThe withdrawal agreement was published shortly after she spoke - 585 pages of E.U. legalese. May will discuss it in Parliament on Thursday.\nFor the past two years, the greatest debate over Brexit has not been waged between Brussels and London, but within May's fractious Conservative Party.\nHard-line Brexiteers have pushed for a decisive split from European bureaucrats and courts, from E.U. rules and regulations, while others, led by May, have sought a softer Brexit, a compromise package that keeps Britain more closely aligned with Europe to better protect the British economy.\nMay got a taste of the disgruntlement of her own backbench on Wednesday, as fellow Conservative Party members heaped derision on a deal that they had not yet seen - but that they feared gave too much away.\nConservative member of Parliament Peter Bone warned May that she was \"not delivering the Brexit people voted for.\" He said, \"Today you will lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.\"\nArch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, who quit his job as foreign secretary over May's proposals in July, had urged cabinet members to reject the agreement. \"It's vassal-state stuff,\" Johnson said. \"For the first time in 1,000 years, this place, this Parliament, will not have a say over the laws that govern this country.\"\nA Conservative member of Parliament who opposes Brexit, Anna Soubry, said Wednesday that British voters should be offered another chance to cast a ballot on whether to support May's deal or remain in the European Union.\nThe best deal, Soubry told the BBC, \"is the deal that we currently have with the European Union.\"\nSammy Wilson, a member of Parliament for Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which May needs to prop up her minority government, told TalkRadio that May's plan \"is not so much a deal as a double-cross.\" \nThe DUP's chief whip at Westminster, Jeffrey Donaldson, said May's half-in, half-out plan \"doesn't give the United Kingdom as a whole the opportunity to do free-trade deals and to take control of its own future.\"\nMost lawmakers in the opposition Labour Party are expected to vote against the plan if and when it reaches Parliament. Ahead of the release of the document Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"From what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country.\"\nOutside Parliament, Nigel Farage, a top Brexit campaigner and a member of the European Parliament,  called May's withdrawal agreement \"the worst deal in history.\"\nIn Europe, there was relief that May had won approval from her divided cabinet.\n\"Green light!\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen tweeted. \"Relieved that the UK government has now approved the deal reached by our negotiators.\"\n\"This agreement is a crucial step in concluding these negotiations,\" said the chief E.U. Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in a late-night news conference in the E.U. capital of Brussels, where he triumphantly waved a copy of the agreement, which he said contained 185 articles, three protocols and a series of annexes. \"We're practically there.\"\nHe said European leaders had been united after what he described as Britain's \"thunderclap\" decision to leave the European Union and took pains not to inflame May's sticky political situation in London.\nBut he confirmed that if negotiators fail to reach a second deal about Britain's future relationship with the E.U. in the coming two years, a fail-safe, politically painful insurance policy would kick in to prevent a border from springing up between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\nThat insurance plan would keep Britain bound inside the E.U. customs zone, obeying E.U. customs rules and regulations but unable to shape them - the exact opposite of the stated goal of Brexit advocates. European officials say they, too, find the situation uncomfortable, since Britain would have tariff-free and quota-free access to the vast E.U. market without being subject to the same demands as other E.U. countries.\nIn London, May's approach had few defenders. But among them was former Conservative Party leader William Hague, who asked his colleagues, \"Did anybody really think you could leave the E.U. without a lot of compromises?\"\nHague urged skeptics to consider the \"big picture.\" He told the BBC that the deal fulfills the mandate the British voters chose when they voted 52 percent to 48 percent in a June 2016 referendum to leave the European bloc.\n\"If what you want is to deliver on leaving the European Union, and have frictionless trade in goods at the border for the next few years until a future free-trade agreement comes into force, and have control of our own immigration policy, and keep the United Kingdom together, all at the same time - well, then, a deal is going to look pretty much like this one seems to look like. It isn't going to be dramatically different from that,\" Hague said.\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nkarla.adam@washpost.com"}, {"id": "174", "title": "May clings to her Brexit deal as support withers", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/britains-brexit-secretary-resigns-over-theresa-mays-plan-to-exit-european-union/2018/11/15/7163f2a2-e859-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "time_stamp": "2018:11:16 00:00:00", "content": "Fellow Conservative says premier's plan is 'dead on arrival' in Parliament\nLONDON - Prime Minister Theresa May faced a volley of cabinet resignations, a torrent of criticism from Parliament and talk of a leadership challenge Thursday, but she insisted that Britain would leave the European Union in March, deal or no deal, and that she would be the leader to \"see this through.\"\nIt was one of the most tumultuous days in recent British politics. Suddenly, everything hung in the balance. Not only was May's future as leader unsure, but so too was the momentous decision to split from the continental bloc.\nSome members of Parliament pleaded with May to stage a second \"people's vote\" to give citizens a chance to rethink Brexit. Others decried her proposals as condemning Britain to years of unbreakable alliance with European rules and regulations - and failing to make good on the vow to \"take back control\" as the pro-Brexit campaign promised two years ago.\nAt risk is the possibility that if a deal isn't finalized by the end of the year, Britain could \"crash out\" of the European Union in March with chaotic uncertainty that could devastate the British economy.\nThe day began with abandonment, as Dominic Raab abruptly resigned as Brexit secretary, saying he could not support the withdrawal agreement that he had helped negotiate and that May's cabinet had approved the night before.\nThis was an especially stinging setback for May. Raab was her second Brexit secretary to quit. Following him out the door Thursday was another cabinet secretary, two junior ministers and three other Conservative lawmakers in government.\nThen, for three grueling hours, May stood virtually alone in the parliamentary chamber, as members, including those from her own Conservative Party, denounced her Brexit plans as a weak capitulation, an act of naive folly or a catastrophe in the making. \nMay later called an evening news conference at 10 Downing Street, where the very first question from the BBC was: \"Is it not the case now that you are in office but you're not really in power?\"\nMay held fast to her script, saying she believes with \"every fiber of my being\" that her Brexit is the right one.\nBut even as she spoke, a leadership contest loomed. \nIn one of the many dramatic moments of the day, Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg announced that he had submitted a formal letter stating he had \"no confidence\" in his prime minister. Rees-Mogg, who has been touted as a possible future leader of the Conservative Party and heads a pro-Brexit faction, said May's deal was \"worse than anticipated and fails to meet the promises given to the nation by the prime minister.\"\nTo trigger a vote of no confidence against May, 48 Conservative lawmakers would have to submit letters calling for such a ballot. By evening, there was no announcement of that threshold being reached.\n\"Am I going to see this through? Yes,\" May said at the news conference.\nPublic confidence in Brexit, too, has been wavering. Although Britain voted to leave the E.U. by 52 percent to 48 percent in June 2016, the latest polls show slightly more voters would prefer to remain. Surveys indicate that people are frustrated with how Brexit is being handled but still prefer May's leadership over anyone else's.\nThe prime minister said Thursday that the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with E.U. officials would get a vote from the leaders of the remaining 27 E.U. states in Brussels on Nov. 25.\nThe deal, which has been compared to the world's most complex divorce settlement, lays out the billions of euros that Britain will pay to leave, what rights Europeans living in Britain will have after Brexit, and how a 21-month transition period will work. \nApproval in Brussels is nearly assured.\nFar more challenging will be getting the deal through Parliament. British lawmakers are supposed to get their say in early December. \nMay on Thursday predicted that the withdrawal agreement would pass but acknowledged the deal was weighed down by compromise.\n\"I know it's been a frustrating process - it has forced us to confront some very difficult issues,\" May conceded to Parliament. \"But a good Brexit, a Brexit which is in the national interest, is possible. We have persevered and have made a decisive breakthrough.\"\nSuch optimism was not visible in the chamber. Hardly anyone stood to support May, as the pound sterling plummeted on currency markets and the hashtag #BrexitShambles was trending.\nMark Francois, a Conservative lawmaker and top Brexiteer, said that by his calculations, 84 Conservative members - a number \"going up by the hour\" - would vote against the agreement. Adding to that, he said, \"the Labour Party have made plain today that they will vote against this deal,\" as will major parties from Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\"It's therefore mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons,\" he said. \"It's dead on arrival.\"\nSarah Wollaston, a Conservative lawmaker and pro-European, said, \"It will be blindingly obvious to the entire country that the prime minister's deal cannot pass this house.\"\nIn his resignation letter, Raab said he could not support May's plan because it treats Northern Ireland's future trading and customs relations with the European Union in a way that \"presents a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.\"\nHe was referring to the deal's \"backstop\" to prevent the reemergence of a hard border - and political tensions - on the island of Ireland. That insurance plan would keep Northern Ireland and, to a lesser degree Great Britain, in a European customs union if Britain and the E.U. fail to sign a future free-trade deal that preserves open borders in Ireland.\nThe rapid-fire resignations sent shudders through E.U. headquarters in Brussels, raising the possibility that May does not have the support she needs to pursue the softer Brexit she negotiated.\nRaab's resignation drew special derision in Europe. \"Who negotiated those UK terms again . . .? Surely the #Brexit Minister had nothing to do with it and learned of the terms yesterday. . .? Oh wait,\" tweeted Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament.\nOfficials in Brussels said it was unclear whether they could offer any changes that would satisfy London any more. \"We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,\" said Michel Barnier, the E.U.'s chief negotiator.\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk sounded resigned to frustration. \"Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control.\"\nMay, though, was still talking in terms of a win.\nAt the end of her news conference, one reporter asked about the prospects of her Brexit effort by using an extended metaphor about the game of cricket. \n\"One of my cricket heroes was always Geoffrey Boycott,\" May replied. \"And what do you know about Geoffrey Boycott? Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it. And he got the runs in the end.\" \nkarla.adam@washpost.com\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com"}], "47": [{"id": "55", "title": "Theresa May to address Parliament one week out from key Brexit vote", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/03/uk/theresa-may-brexit-speech-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2018:12:3 00:00:00", "content": "UK Prime Minister Theresa May will attempt to drum up parliamentary support for her beleaguered Brexit bill later Tuesday, as lawmakers prepare to vote on whether she broke the rules over publishing the full legal advice on her plan.\nMay is expected to tell lawmakers that her deal -- agreed last month with European leaders but opposed by large swaths of opposition parties and even her own Conservatives -- \"delivers for our country.\"\nBut her speech has been delayed because lawmakers are holding a debate about whether she or her ministers should be held in contempt of parliament for ignoring a vote to publish the legal advice on her deal in full.\nIn theory, she or her ministers could be expelled from parliament if the vote goes against her. In practice, a lesser sanction is likely to be applied.\nIn her speech, May will say that her deal delivers on the Brexit referendum. \"An end to free movement once and for all. An end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. An end to those vast sums we send to Brussels every year. And a fair settlement of our financial obligations, less than half what some predicted,\" according to prepared remarks shared ahead of her speech.\n\"A new Free Trade Area with no tariffs, fees, quantitative restrictions or rules of origin checks -- an unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has. And at the same time, the freedom to have an independent trade policy and to strike new trade deals all around the world.\"\nWhile May mentions the \"integrity of our United Kingdom,\" and the importance of border control, her provided remarks notably do not directly touch on the issue of Northern Ireland, which has emerged as the main hurdle for any Brexit deal.\nOne of the biggest concerns about Brexit is that it could lead to the return of a hard border between EU member the Republic of Ireland, and Brexiting Northern Ireland -- which many fear could lead to a return to violence in the region.\nIn order to avoid this, May agreed a backstop arrangement with European leaders, whereby failure to reach an alternate deal defaults to a \"single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom,\" which could potentially continue indefinitely until all parties are satisfied with an alternative solution.\nSuch a situation would essentially leave the UK both in and out of the EU, in line with all EU regulations and rules but unable to influence them. It would also block the most ambitious post-Brexit policies of hardliners in May's Party, many of whom see such a deal as anathema to the 2016 vote on leaving the EU.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), a right-wing Northern Irish party which currently props up May's minority government in Westminster, has already indicated the backstop is unacceptable to it, and has also threatened to vote down any deal which would see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nOn Monday, DUP lawmakers joined with opposition parties in submitting an emergency motion accusing the government of holding Parliament in contempt after it ignored a vote obliging it to publish legal advice it sought on the Brexit deal.\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox briefed Parliament on the legal advice but the government did not publish the advice in full, arguing that Cox's statements were sufficient to satisfy lawmakers' demands.\nThe DUP had been hoping to learn more about what advice the government sought about the Northern Ireland backstop. Lawmakers will debate the contempt motion on Tuesday ahead of May's remarks.\nElection, or second referendum?\nShould May lose the Brexit vote next week, Labour has said it will almost certainly seek a vote of no confidence in her government, a move that could bring her premiership down and force a general election.\nFailing that, the left-wing party has pledged to campaign for a second referendum or so-called \"People's Vote\" on Brexit, something May appears to warn against in her remarks due to be made on Tuesday.\n\"Ultimately, membership of any Union that involves the pooling of sovereignty can only be sustained with the consent of the people,\" May will say.\n\"In the referendum of 2016, the biggest democratic exercise in our history, the British public withdrew that consent.\"\nMay will tell lawmakers that the British people \"want us to get on with a deal that honors the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted.\""}, {"id": "56", "title": "Brexit in turmoil as UK government suffers historic defeats", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/04/uk/brexit-legal-advice-contempt-of-court-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2018:12:4 00:00:00", "content": "Theresa May suffered the worst day in parliament for a British government in 40 years, losing three crucial votes as lawmakers moved to seize control of the faltering Brexit process.\nThe Prime Minister's authority was left hanging by a thread after Members of Parliament found her government in contempt for failing to publish the full legal advice underpinning her Brexit plan.\nIn a further and potentially more important defeat, lawmakers approved an amendment that aims to give Parliament greater say if May's Brexit deal is rejected next week. Parliament could then insist on a \"softer\" Brexit -- where the UK would remain in or closely aligned with the EU's customs union and single market, or even demand a second Brexit referendum.\nMPs had already rejected a government compromise on the legal advice, under which the issue would have been kicked to a parliamentary committee. No British government has suffered a worse day at the hands of MPs for 40 years.\nMay's minority administration -- notionally propped up by the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland -- was left in turmoil as it became clear it could not win support for crucial votes in the House of Commons.\nThe opposition Labour Party's Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, said the defeat on the legal advice, by 311 votes to 293, was a \"badge of shame\" for the government. The decision had \"huge constitutional and political significance,\" he told Britain's Press Association.\nThe unprecedented contempt vote was prompted by the government's refusal to publish the legal advice on May's Brexit deal, despite having previously accepted a parliamentary motion directing it to do so.\nThe attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, had argued it was not in Britain's national interest to publish it in full, and instead offered a summary to Parliament on Monday. \"There is nothing to see here,\" Cox insisted. May told her Cabinet on Tuesday that \"candid\" legal advice given to ministers must remain confidential.\nStarmer told the House of Commons that the government was \"willfully refusing to comply\" with the binding order issued by lawmakers. \"That is contempt,\" he said, adding that the government had ignored the motion for months.\nDay of defeats\nThe day started badly for May's government when a top EU legal adviser ruled that the UK could unilaterally halt the Brexit process.\nIn an opinion prepared for the European Court of Justice, the advocate general said the UK did not need the approval of the 27 remaining EU member states to halt the two-year countdown triggered invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The UK government had fought the case, saying it had no intention of stopping the Brexit process.\nAfter the later parliamentary defeats, May opened a five-day Commons debate on her Brexit plans. She urged lawmakers to support her proposals when they come to vote December 11. \"This argument has gone on long enough,\" May told the House of Commons. \"It is corrosive to our politics. And life depends on compromise.\"\nShe added that compromise was necessary to \"bring the country together.\"\n\"I know there are some in this House and in the country who would prefer a closer relationship with the European Union than the one I'm proposing, indeed who would prefer the relationship that we currently have and want another referendum,\" she said.\n\"The hard truth is that we will not settle this issue and bring our country together that way, and I ask them to think what it would say to the 52% who came out to vote Leave in many cases for the first time in decades if their decision were ignored.\""}, {"id": "57", "title": "Brexit remains divisive, even now, in leave-majority areas", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/07/uk/brexit-matlock-england-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2018:12:6 00:00:00", "content": "There's a faded grandeur to the small town of Matlock in England's Midlands.\nNestled at the bottom of a limestone gorge, the streets are lined with chocolate box houses and antique furniture shops.\nThe town may appear sleepy, but the people of Matlock are anything but; they're politically engaged and alert to the machinations of Westminster, 140 miles away.\nTheir constituency, the Derbyshire Dales, had a turnout of 82% in the Brexit referendum, one of the highest recorded across the country.

Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has become a figurehead for the far right in Britain and is currently an adviser to UKIP leader Gerard Batten.\nIn response, thousands of anti-racism campaigners and Labour-backed groups staged a counter protest on the same day under the banner \"Stand Up to Racism.\" Demonstrators expressed concern about what they say is the growth of the far right in the country.\nMay is facing pressure from some sections of her party over her deal, particularly the backstop arrangement for the Northern Ireland border.\nTuesday's vote is likely to be tense, with Labour, Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party and Northern Ireland's Democratic Nationalist Party, which has propped up the government since the general election in June 2017, all set to vote against the deal.\nSpeaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Conservative lawmaker Esther McVey, who quit the Cabinet over the Brexit deal last month, warned that defeat for May would mean she should \"immediately\" return to the European Union to \"get a better deal\" if she loses in the Commons.\nShe cited the backstop to the Northern Ireland border should be removed, a deal that Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, claims will leave the UK open to \"blackmail.\"\n\"The real problem with the backstop arrangement is it gives the power to Brussels and to all the other EU member states effectively to blackmail us and to get what they want out of the future trade negotiation,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. \"It is a diabolical negotiating position.\"\nThe government's perilous position has led to speculation that Tuesday's vote may be rescheduled with May reportedly struggling for numbers.\nBut Steve Barclay, her third Brexit Secretary, insists the vote will go ahead as planned.\n\"The vote is going ahead,\" he told the BBC."}, {"id": "117", "title": "UK Parliament, PM May's govt face off in Brexit showdown", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.apnews.com/543d979cc7b74de0864663d497b6b2c7", "time_stamp": "2018:12:5 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - British lawmakers opened Round Two in their bruising battle with Prime Minister Theresa May's government over her Brexit deal, as the release of previously secret legal advice provided more ammunition for opponents of her unpopular divorce agreement with the European Union.\nMay's Conservative government is struggling to convince skeptical legislators that the divorce deal it has struck with the EU is a good one ahead of a vote in Parliament on Tuesday that could sink the agreement and possibly cost May her job.\nMay's deal is in trouble because politicians on both sides of Britain's EU membership debate oppose it. Pro-Brexit lawmakers say it keeps Britain bound too closely to the EU; pro-EU politicians say it erects barriers between the U.K. and its biggest trading partner and leaves many details of the future relationship undecided, subject to negotiations after Britain leaves the bloc on March 29.\nA defeat in the vote next week would leave the U.K. facing a messy, economically damaging \"no-deal\" Brexit on March 29 and could topple the prime minister, her government, or both. EU officials have said they agreed upon a Brexit deal with May, and there's no \"Plan B.\"\nOpening the second of five days of debate, Home Secretary Sajid Javid told legislators Wednesday they should back the Brexit agreement to safeguard Britain's vital security relationship with the EU.\n\"No one can pretend that this deal is perfect in every sense,\" Javid acknowledged. But he said the alternative was \"an uncooperative no-deal\" Brexit that would shut Britain out of EU security tools and EU data-sharing organizations.\n\"It is my belief that the deal on the table is the best option available in ensuring a smooth exit from the European Union,\" Javid said.\nBut opposition Labour Party lawmaker Chris Bryant said the agreement's vision for future relations with the EU was \"no more deliverable than a letter to Santa Claus.\"\n\"How could a serious member of Parliament vote for nothing more than a wish list?\" he said.\nMay is struggling to keep the Brexit deal on track after her government was dealt a double blow by Parliament.\nIn a historic first, legislators on Tuesday found the government in contempt of Parliament for refusing to publish legal advice it received from the country's top law officer about the Brexit agreement. The government had argued that such advice is customarily kept secret. But it bowed to defeat Wednesday and released the reasoning from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.\nThe main thrust of Cox's advice was already known - the government released a 43-page document about it Monday in a bid to fend off the contempt motion. But the defeat demonstrated the fragility of May's government, which does not have a majority in Parliament.\nThe legal advice also provided fuel for May's opponents, who dislike a \"backstop\" provision in the Brexit agreement that would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU to guarantee an open border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland.\nThe backstop is intended as a temporary measure, but pro-Brexit lawmakers say it could leave Britain tied to the EU indefinitely and unable to strike new trade deals around the world.\nThe legal advice confirmed that Britain can't unilaterally opt out of the backstop, which requires an agreement by both sides. Cox advised there was a risk the U.K. might become stuck in \"protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations.\"\nThe border backstop is strongly opposed by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government. The Protestant, pro-British DUP says the deal weakens the bonds of the United Kingdom by treating Northern Ireland differently than the rest of the country.\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the backstop \"is totally unacceptable to unionists throughout the United Kingdom and it must be defeated.\"\nThe DUP and pro-Brexit Conservatives want May to go back to the EU and try to renegotiate the backstop. Both May and the bloc insist the withdrawal agreement can't be changed, and rejecting it means leaving without a Brexit deal.\nIn another blow to May, two dozen Conservative lawmakers voted with the opposition Tuesday to force an amendment to Brexit plans that gives lawmakers more say over what happens next if the deal is defeated in Parliament.\nPro-EU legislators say the amendment makes the prospect of a \"no-deal\" Brexit less likely, because Parliament can direct the government to take that option off the table.\nBrexit-supporting legislators worry that opponents of Brexit in Parliament may try to water down the terms of departure from the EU, or even reverse the country's decision to leave.\nInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Wednesday there was \"a real danger that the House of Commons, which has a natural 'Remain' majority, may attempt to steal Brexit from the British people.\"\nFox said that would be \"a democratic affront\" to the 52 percent of British voters who opted in a 2016 referendum to leave the bloc.\n___"}, {"id": "129", "title": "UK prime minister says Brexit deal with EU still 'the best deal that is negotiable,' aims to win Parliament's support", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.apnews.com/12795c5569ea455fa8280dc904ca9f99", "time_stamp": "2018:12:10 00:00:00", "content": ""}], "49": [{"id": "59", "title": "Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote but her Brexit deal is still in peril", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/12/uk/theresa-may-no-confidence-vote-result-brexit-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2018:12:12 00:00:00", "content": "UK Prime Minister Theresa May survived a vote of no-confidence triggered by members of her own party over her handling of Britain's departure from the European Union, but her margin of victory was significantly narrower than her supporters expected.\nMay won by 200 votes to 117, meaning that a third of her parliamentary party failed to back her.

But it was hardly a victory.\nThe public brawling and parliamentary challenge by her fellow Tories leaves May a wounded leader. The British prime minister is now immune to a leadership challenge by her party for a year, but she faces lawmakers hostile to her Brexit deal, which remains broadly unpopular.\nIn Brussels, May's survival offered measured relief to E.U. leaders, who have little option other than hoping she can hold on and get the Brexit deal approved by Parliament before the March 29 exit date.\nBut many countries have sped up emergency preparations, fearing that Britain's political paralysis will lead it to crash out of the E.U. without a deal.\n\"Glad about the outcome of tonight's vote,\" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz wrote on Twitter. \"Our shared goal is to avoid a no-deal scenario.\"\nA no-deal Brexit could result in chaos at ports, a freeze in trade, empty grocery stores, grounded aircraft and the threat of recession, economists have warned.\nGuy Verhofstadt, a Belgian politician and Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament, tweeted, \"Even in the Tory party, there is no majority for no deal or hard Brexit.\"\nShortly after the vote that saved her job, May said, \"This has been a long and challenging day. But, at the end of it, I'm pleased to have received the backing of my colleagues in tonight's ballot.\"\nMay declared she had a \"renewed mission - delivering the Brexit people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that really works for everyone.\"\nShe had earlier warned rebellious lawmakers that ousting her would not make getting a better Brexit deal any easier but would bring delay and confusion.\nIn an 11th-hour meeting with her backbench, apparently to win further support, May told Tory members that she would not stand for election before the public again.\nGeorge Freeman, a Conservative member of Parliament, spoke of a \"powerful and moving moment\" as May told her fellow Tories that she has \"listened, heard and respects the will of the party\" and that once she delivers Brexit \"she will step aside for the election of a new leader to lead the reunification and renewal we need.\" Delivering Brexit, however, could take months or, more likely, years.\nMay and her Brexit plan have been pummeled for weeks by members of Parliament, from her own party and the opposition. Hard-line Brexiteers want a cleaner break from the E.U., while remainers worry about the economic and other costs of what May has proposed.\nBut faced with the prospect of losing their leader in a no-confidence vote, a long string of top Tories publicly declared their support for May - previewing that the prime minister would survive the day.\nPhilip Hammond, the chancellor of the exchequer, called the Tory rebels who pressed for the vote \"extremists.\" He tweeted: \"The Prime Minister has worked hard in the National interest since the day she took office and will have my full support in the vote tonight. Her deal means we leave the EU on time, whilst protecting our jobs and our businesses.\"\nConservative lawmaker Geoffrey Cox tweeted before the vote that he would be backing May, adding, \"This is no time for the self indulgent spasm of a leadership election.\"\nMay triggered the ire of lawmakers when she announced Monday that she was delaying a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, after concluding it would have faced a devastating defeat in the House of Commons. \nShe spent Tuesday meeting with Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and E.U. leaders, trying to concoct new concessions that might appease British lawmakers. But the Europeans have been uniformly opposed to any substantive and binding changes to what the two sides have negotiated.\nFor the Tories to challenge May, ostensibly their party leader, they needed to send at least 48 letters - equaling 15 percent of the 317 Conservative lawmakers - to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, a panel made up of all Conservative backbenchers in Parliament.\nBrady told the BBC that he informed the prime minister on Tuesday night that the threshold of 48 letters had been reached.\nParty members voted by secret ballot Wednesday evening, so it was not until Brady's 9 p.m. announcement that it was clear May would continue on.\nAmber Rudd, a top Tory leader, called the vote a \"strong result\" for May. \"Now we can get on with the important work ahead,\" Rudd said.\nBut the result did little to quiet May's critics.\n\"Tonight's vote makes no difference to the lives of our people,\" opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said in written a statement. \"The Prime Minister has lost her majority in Parliament, her government is in chaos and she is unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first.\"\nJacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative member of Parliament and an arch-Brexiteer, called the vote \"a terrible result\" for May. Although it did not force May's ouster, Rees-Mogg said that it was enough to show how little confidence her party had in her and that she should  resign.\nCommentators drew comparisons to Margaret Thatcher, Britain's only other female prime minister, who won a confidence vote but resigned anyway in 1990.\nThe leader of Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, expressed frustration with the political squabbling. She tweeted: \"Today is a stark reminder that the UK is facing chaos and crisis entirely because of a vicious civil war within the Tory party. What a self-centered bunch they are. They all need to go, not just the PM.\"\nTim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said May's survival will hardly solve the Conservative Party's Brexit problems. \"Is the problem actually the prime minister? The problem is what it has always been. Any deal that could pass muster with the E.U. won't pass muster with Tory Euroskeptics.\"\nIn Brussels, where preparations are underway for a summit of European leaders Thursday and Friday for which Brexit is only one among many issues, diplomats were measured in their reaction to the British drama. Many have long braced for a challenge to May's leadership, and although the British instability added to uncertainty surrounding the Brexit deal, several diplomats said there was little they could do to sway events in London.\nIf anything, the leadership challenge hardened resolve among the remaining E.U. nations to insist on an ironclad backup plan to preserve a border-free frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Diplomats increasingly doubt that they can rely on assurances from any British leader, because that leader can quickly be replaced.\nBritain's crashing out of the E.U. with no deal could also lead to the imposition of border controls between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, meaning that the E.U. and Britain both have motivation to resolve the issue.\n\"We do not have any intention of further changing the withdrawal agreement,\" Merkel told the German parliament on Wednesday. \"That is the common position of the 27 member states.\" \nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nkarla.adam@washpost.com\nmichael.birnbaum@washpost.com"}], "50": [{"id": "60", "title": "Decision day for May's Brexit bill as UK Parliament holds key vote", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/15/uk/brexit-decision-day-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2019:1:15 00:00:00", "content": "Shortly after 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, British MPs face a choice that will affect the country's 66 million citizens for many years to come.\nThey will either vote to support Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, negotiated with the European Union, and set the country on its final road to leaving the EU on March 29. Or they will vote against it, leaving the UK Parliament, and the country, in the state of limbo it has inhabited for two-and-a-half years.\nBy every calculation and prediction, May will lose the vote. Her ruling Conservative Party and its ally, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), hold a bare majority in the 650-seat Parliament, but some estimates predict May's Brexit bill could be defeated by more than 100 votes.\nLast ditch\nThe Prime Minister has spent the past week pushing hard for support for her deal, wielding both carrots and sticks -- drinks receptions at Downing Street for wayward Conservative MPs and soothing phone calls to opposition Labour members: and threats that failure to support her deal would lead to Brexit being canceled and paralysis in Parliament.\nThe PM told the House of Commons on Monday that a \"no deal\" Brexit could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom and appealed to MPs to give her plans a \"second look.\"\nEven EU leaders tried to help May's campaign by issuing a statement on Monday setting out assurances that the controversial backstop, an insurance policy to prevent a hard border in Ireland, would only be temporary -- but pro-Brexit lawmakers remained skeptical because the assurances carried no additional legal force.\nAnd so, barring a few MPs who changed their minds, it does not look like May's attempts at persuasion have worked. The big question in Westminster is now no longer whether or not she wins, but who will take control of the fallout narrative.\nLast-ditch attempts to minimize a crushing defeat for May faded Tuesday lunchtime when the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, declined to accept an amendment to government legislation which could have won over more Tory Brexiteers into supporting May's deal.\nThe amendment, tabled by Conservative backbencher Andrew Murrison, would have set a time limit on the most contentious sticking point for Brexiteers, the Northern Ireland backstop. There was skepticism that, even if this amendment had passed, it would have been agreed by EU leaders.\nBut at least it could have staved off a triple-figure defeat for May and changed the whole dynamic of the current Brexit state of play. A separate amendment on ensuring the backstop was temporary was also not selected.\nThere will, however, be a vote which, if passed, would require the government to terminate the withdrawal agreement if the EU refuses to remove the backstop at the end of 2021. This vote will take place before the substantive vote on May's deal, but it is unlikely to save the PM from defeat.\nMay's aides in Downing Street are scrambling to ensure the Prime Minister looks in command of events, even if she loses badly.\nIt is likely she will deliver a speech in the Commons shortly after the vote setting out her next steps, including possibly an alternative plan that she can take back to the European Union for approval -- and then get through Parliament.\nYet factions in all political parties will be poised to fix their own narrative, too.\nPro-Brexit Conservatives, who tried and failed to unseat May as Prime Minister in a confidence vote last month, believe Downing Street is playing up reports that the margin of defeat for May's bill could be higher than 200 -- making it the worst for a Prime Minister in British history -- as a way of managing expectations and making a narrower defeat look like a minor victory.\nThese Brexiteers want to use the likely defeat to show that the government must take a radically different path -- and leave the EU without a negotiated deal.\nThis is the hardest of all Brexit models, but one which Euroskeptic Conservatives believe will give the UK their cherished dream of freedom from the EU.\nElection time?\nOn the opposition benches, the Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, will demand a general election if May's bill fails, hoping to pave the way for fresh talks between a new government and the EU.\nThere is no indication that a motion of no confidence in the government introduced by Corbyn -- which, if successful, would spark a general election -- will pass. Even if Labour does take power, the party is as divided as the Conservatives on Brexit, and many of its MPs want the nation to vote in a more definitive way -- through a second referendum that could see Britain remaining in the EU altogether.\nCorbyn will face intense pressure from many Labour lawmakers and grassroots activists to back a second referendum as the only way to break the impasse if he fails to force an election.\nThere is a third main group who have set in motion a process to take control of Brexit: an informal coalition of MPs from all parties who are angling for a softer Brexit than the one envisaged by May's deal, one that retains economic ties with the EU, similar to the arrangement adopted by Norway -- which occupies an highly unusual territory both in, and outside of, the EU.\nIt is this group that could form the center of gravity within Parliament amid the fallout from May's likely defeat.\nWhatever happens, the UK Parliament will be the scene of a PR war, as opposition factions try to take control of Brexit from the political vacuum left by May's dwindling authority.\nTo a weary UK public, this spectacle is likely to dismay voters who do not know whether to take seriously warnings from government departments over the stockpiling of medicines and food and heavy traffic queues in the event of a no deal.\nThere are still 73 days left before Brexit, and the sense of uncertainty for ordinary voters is palpable."}, {"id": "61", "title": "A humiliating Brexit defeat, but May will likely stagger on", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/16/uk/may-vote-of-no-confidence-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2019:1:15 00:00:00", "content": "Just 24 hours after incurring a historic parliamentary defeat, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces another challenge to her premiership: A vote of no confidence in her government.\nAnyone who doubted the degree of chaos in British politics right now should consider this: Many MPs who Wednesday will vote to save May's government are the same MPs who Tuesday night inflicted the defeat of her Brexit deal which triggered the confidence vote in question.\nPro-Brexit Conservative MPs don't like the prime minister's deal to withdraw from the European Union, but they really hate the prospect of a Labour government under the hard-left Jeremy Corbyn.\nIf the prime minister were seeking a crumb of comfort after her agreement was rejected in the Commons by a crushing 432 votes to 202, it is this. She is likely to win the confidence vote introduced by Corbyn and supported by other opposition parties.\nBrexiteer Conservative MPs and the DUP, the Northern Irish party on which May relies for a majority in the Commons, have made clear they will support the government in the vote at around 1900 GMT on Wednesday.\nBut this does not mean they believe she is the right person to see Brexit through. Rather, they will take advantage of her hugely weakened authority to campaign for a harder Brexit -- or even, as some Conservative MPs hope, a \"no deal\" departure. Likewise, Remain-supporting Tories will push for a softer Brexit deal -- one that can win the support of MPs of all parties.\nEven though May is certain to win the confidence vote, the fact that it is taking place at all is historic and hugely damaging to a sitting prime minister. On Tuesday evening, she made clear she was not about to resign voluntarily, even though this might normally be expected after a defeat of such magnitude.\nHer strategy, after winning the confidence vote as expected Wednesday evening, is to return to the Commons next Monday with an alternative Brexit plan that can test the mood of Parliament. She has said that if she wins the vote she will listen to the concerns of its MPs.\nThe problem is that the EU must approve any changes to the withdrawal agreement, which was hammered out over two years of fraught negotiations and finally struck in November. It is not something that can be tweaked in less than a week. The mood in Brussels is as unbending as is May's refusal to stand down.\nReports from the European Commission were that EU leaders will fiercely resist reopening the withdrawal agreement to allow changes and will block any attempt to set a time limit, a key Brexiteer demand, on the contentious Northern Ireland backstop -- the insurance policy that avoids a hard border in Ireland. May's allies also believe that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated with the EU.\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, strongly hinted that the best option now would be for the UK to stay in the EU when he tweeted last night: \"If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?\"\nMany MPs and British voters believe the solution is indeed staying in the EU, or at least holding a second referendum to save the country, as they see it, from a bad Brexit. This is also the view of the Scottish National Party, which governs Scotland, and the smaller opposition parties. Official Labour policy is to push for a fresh general election first, before then calling for a second referendum, but as many as 100 of its MPs are reportedly planning explicitly to call Wednesday for a second referendum.\nThe SNP is demanding an extension of Article 50, the process which sets the timetable for departure from the EU on March 29th, to allow more time for negotiations. Although official SNP policy favors another referendum, delaying the departure date increases the chances of no Brexit at all.\nNicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, urged May to postpone Brexit to give more time for a consensus, tweeting: \"Spoke to PM earlier -- not obvious that she has any real idea what to do next. Also not at all clear she is open to any fundamental change of thinking in her proposed cross party talks. The bare minimum she must do now is seek extension of Article 50 to stop the clock.\""}, {"id": "87", "title": "It's a huge day for Brexit - but the divorce deal appears doomed", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/theresa-may-s-brexit-plan-appears-doomed-key-parliamentary-vote-n958701", "time_stamp": "2019:1:15 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/theresa-may-s-brexit-plan-appears-doomed-key-parliamentary-vote-n958701\nA lack of consensus in the PM's Conservative Party - and Parliament as a whole - for any one particular type of withdrawal is at the heart of the problem.\nClick to view image\nhttps://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2019_03/2716281/190115-brexit-deal-day-mc-10003_be2c2a674bf0728ba4b9539be981ed3c.JPG\nFacundo Arrizabalaga\nImage: MPs debate Brexit draft\nThe Houses of Parliament in London.\nClick to view image\nhttps://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2019_03/2716276/190115-theresa-may-mc-1000_be2c2a674bf0728ba4b9539be981ed3c.JPG\nBen Birchall\nImage: BBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May gives a speech at a factory in Stoke-on-Trent\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May gives a speech at a factory in Stoke-on-Trent to call on MP's to support her Brexit bill on Jan. 14, 2019.\nClick to view image\nhttps://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2019_03/2716291/190115-brexit-deal-day-mc-1000_be2c2a674bf0728ba4b9539be981ed3c.JPG\nTolga Akmen\nImage: An anti-Brexit demonstration\nAn anti-Brexit demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Monday.\nClick to view image\nhttps://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2019_03/2716286/190115-brexit-deal-day-mc-10002_be2c2a674bf0728ba4b9539be981ed3c.JPG\nOli Scarff\nImage: A pro-Brexit supporter"}, {"id": "88", "title": "Theresa May's Brexit deal crushed in parliamentary vote", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/british-prime-minister-may-loses-historic-vote-her-brexit-deal-n958791", "time_stamp": "2019:1:15 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/british-prime-minister-may-loses-historic-vote-her-brexit-deal-n958791\nMoments after the vote, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, announced he would seek to oust May's ruling Conservatives by bringing a motion of no confidence.\nClick to view image\nhttps://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2019_03/2716686/190115-theresa-may-al-1034_c603892eb7813155f4e677037f57ebe8.jpg\nNeil Hall\nImage: Theresa May"}, {"id": "178", "title": "Theresa May's parliamentary humiliation", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/theresa-may-experiences-a-historic-parliamentary-humiliation/2019/01/15/56d0aed8-1907-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:1:16 00:00:00", "content": "We guessed it. But now we know: There was no Plan B. \nAfter months of negotiation and many hours of debate, after long delays and rumors of more delays, after protesters had rung bells and waved European flags outside the Palace of Westminster all afternoon, the British House of Commons finally voted on the \"withdrawal deal\" that Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated with the European Union. \nAs expected, the deal was defeated. Not only that, but it was defeated by 230 votes - the biggest parliamentary defeat for any British government in living memory. \nAs expected, the opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has called for a vote of no confidence in the government. The debate will be held Wednesday. In all likelihood, the Conservative Party will win. \nAnd after that - then what? The \"no\" voters included people who want Britain to remain in the E.U. and people who want Britain to crash out of all of its trading and economic arrangements without any deal at all. This vote makes both of those options possible. May has not offered a third. \nInstead, she has said people want \"clarity.\" She  said she will \"hold meetings with my colleagues . . . to identity what would be required to secure the backing of the  House.\" The government, she said, \"will approach these meetings in a constructive spirit,\" a comment that evoked some bitter laughter. Presumably she will go back to Europe, pull some carefully constructed rabbits out of hats - then ask her colleagues to vote again. She claims that her strategy is not to \"run down the clock.\" More worrying than that thought, though, is the fact there doesn't seem to be a strategy at all.\nOthers will now fill the vacuum. The House of Commons itself may come up with some proposals, and there are a few floating around. The People's Vote campaign is calling for the deadlock to be resolved by a new referendum. One of its leaders told me recently that the campaign is now hoping to be \"the last option standing\": After everything else is voted down, there may be no other choice. May continues to push back against a second referendum for a simple reason: Polling is showing increasing numbers of people opposed to Brexit. Indeed, when Britons are offered the choice between remaining in the E.U. and any other concrete option - May's deal, or no deal - a clear majority favors Remain. But because that outcome would split the Conservative Party, and because the Conservative Party is May's whole life, she wants to avoid that at any cost. And so here we are. \nInevitably, the coming days will be filled with the minutiae of negotiations and parliamentary procedure. But before that happens, let this sink in: Brexit has been a catastrophic political failure. This messy, unpopular deal, the most unpopular government policy that anybody can remember, was produced by a political class that turned out to be ignorant - about Europe, Europeans, trade arrangements, institutions - and arrogant, disdaining knowledge and expertise. It was the work of leaders who favored identity politics over economics, who preferred an undefined notion of \"sovereignty\" to the real institutions that gave Britain influence and power, who believed in fantasies and scorned reality. \nTime that could have been spent on other things - on debating defense, or poverty, or clean beaches - has been wasted on a policy that won't make Britain happier, wealthier or stronger. Instead, this long debate has produced confusion and gridlock. And after Tuesday's vote, more of that is coming."}, {"id": "179", "title": "May's Brexit plan is rejected", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/brexit-vote-2019/2019/01/15/8eb6579a-1816-11e9-b8e6-567190c2fd08_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:1:16 00:00:00", "content": "Landslide vote raises serious questions about Britain's exit from E.U.\nLONDON - With just 73 days to go until Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union, lawmakers Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected - by a vote of 432 to 202 - the withdrawal deal painstakingly negotiated between Prime Minister Theresa May and her European counterparts.\nThe landslide vote was pure humiliation for a British leader who has spent the past two years trying to sell her vision of Brexit to a skeptical public, and her failure raised serious questions about how - and if - Britain will leave the E.U. as promised on March 29.\nHardcore Brexiteers, such as former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, cheered the result as increasing the chances of Britain leaving the European Union with no deal and no compromises - or with a much, much better deal than May or E.U. leaders say is realistic. At the same time, those who want to see a second referendum on Brexit, and who want to stay in the union, think May's loss gets them closer to their goal.\nThe political turmoil heightened fears among European leaders that Britain will crash out of the bloc in a chaotic, no-deal departure that would have harsh economic and humanitarian consequences on both sides of the English Channel.\n\"The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening's vote,\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in a statement. \"While we do not want this to happen, the European Commission will continue its contingency work to help ensure the EU is fully prepared.\" \nIn the House of Commons on Tuesday, May stood almost alone, flashing defiance and frustration, as many in her own party abandoned their leader.\nHistorians had to go as far back as the Victorian age to find a comparable party split and parliamentary defeat - to Prime Minister William Gladstone's support for Irish home rule in 1886, which cut the Liberal Party in two.\n\"The events in Parliament today are really quite remarkable,\" said University of Cambridge political historian Luke Blaxill. \"This doesn't happen.\" Meaning, usually British parties fight with one another in Parliament - but members don't tear their own parties apart.\nJeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour Party leader, called the loss \"historic\" and said May's routine of \"delay and denial\" had led to disaster. \"She cannot seriously believe after two years of failure she is capable of negotiating a good deal,\" Corbyn said.\nHe then introduced a motion of no confidence, to be debated and voted upon Wednesday.\nAfterward, leaders of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, announced that they would support the prime minister, thereby making her ouster unlikely.\nRob Ford, a professor of politics at Manchester University, said these were indeed strange times. \"Normally, if you were looking at a defeat of 50-plus votes on the No. 1 item on the government's agenda, then that would be it. Game over. The prime minister would be gone, and the government would probably fall immediately. But that's clearly not going to happen,\" Ford said.\nMay called Tuesday's vote in Parliament the most important in a generation. She told lawmakers that the choice was plain: support her imperfect compromise deal - the only one Europe will abide, she stressed - or face the cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit. \nStaring directly at Corbyn, May said anyone who thought they could go to Brussels and get a better deal was deluding themselves.\nBut the vote against her plan was decisive.\nMoments after the result came in, May said, \"The government has heard what the House has said tonight.\"\nShe has until Monday to return with a Plan B. Her office has been tight-lipped about what alternatives she might offer. May said she would reach out to members of Parliament to find out what kind of Brexit deal, if any, they would endorse.\n\"What Theresa May does now will become less and less relevant to what outcome we get. The key thing to be watching is what Parliament does next and what Labour does next,\" Ford said.\nOther European leaders, who expected the deal to fail, were stunned by the scale. Yet they said they saw little they could do to try to ease any agreement through the British Parliament. \n\"Maybe we'll make improvements on one or two things,\" said French President Emmanuel Macron. \"But I don't really think so, because we've reached the maximum of what we could do with the deal, and we won't, just to solve Britain's domestic political issues, stop defending European interests.\"\nGuy Verhofstadt, the Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament, sounded especially frustrated. \"The House of Commons today said they don't want this deal. I want to know what deal the House of Commons really does want? Because otherwise you can't make an agreement.\"\nAt least one prominent voice suggested that Britain might reconsider its divorce effort altogether. \"If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?\" European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted.\nBritain could ask to postpone Brexit beyond March 29 and try to buy more time to work out its problems. An extension would require unanimous consent from the remaining E.U. countries. \"It creates a great deal of uncertainty and worries,\" Macron said.\nIn the chamber at Westminster, the debate before Tuesday's vote was impassioned and divided. As members hooted and jeered, the speaker gaveled them to be quiet, complaining of the \"noisy and unseemly atmosphere.\" \n\"The House must calm itself. Zen!\" John Bercow shouted.\nRising Labour Party star David Lammy recalled how he had confronted constituents who sympathized with the violence carried out by London rioters in 2011. Now he said he felt the same duty to confront his neighbors on Brexit.\n\"Why? Because we have a duty to tell our constituents the truth, even when they passionately disagree,\" Lammy said. \"Brexit is a con, a trick, a swindle, a fraud.\" \nIn another emotional speech, Geoffrey Cox, a Conservative lawmaker and the attorney general, urged the chamber to back May's deal. \"What are you playing at? What are you doing? You are not children in the playground. You are legislators, and it is your job. We are playing with people's lives,\" Cox said.\nOutside Parliament, the scene was raucous. Thousands of protesters, many in costumes, gathered to shout at each other - illustrating how unsettled Brexit remains more than two years after voters opted in a 2016 June referendum to leave the E.U.\nBrexiteers banged drums and rang a \"liberty\" bell, while pro-E.U. demonstrators handed out \"Bollocks to Brexit\" stickers in Parliament Square beside two huge video screens set up for the live broadcast of the final speeches and the vote.\nJeff Wyatt, 54, a pro-Brexit voter, held aloft a placard that accused May of treason. Another man in the crowd suggested that the prime minister should face the executioner's ax.\n\"For the first time in the history of my country, we've got Parliament against the people,\" Wyatt said, gesturing at the Palace of Westminster.\nMonika Wolf, 57, was clutching an E.U. flag and a Union Jack. She moved to Britain from Germany in 1981 and studied and raised her children here. In an ideal world, she said, Brexit would be stopped. She hoped to see \"more statesmanship from the big parties - they both talk about bringing the country together, but so far they haven't done anything at all to make that happen.\"\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nkarla.adam@washpost.com\nmichael.birnbaum@washpost.com"}], "3": [{"id": "62", "title": "OBAMA'S 'FRIENDLY' WARNING OF DANGERS OF BREXIT", "publisher": "Newsweek", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/obama-brexit-daily-telegraph-column-visit-451179", "time_stamp": "2016:4:30 00:00:00", "content": "US President\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0has urged Britons to keep their \u201coutsized\u201d global influence and honour years of transatlantic co-operation by voting to remain in the EU.\nIn a strongly-worded column for the\u00a0Daily Telegraph\u00a0newspaper, Obama acknowledged that the June 23\u00a0EU membership referendum\u00a0is a \u201cmatter for British voters,\u201d but said he felt bound to recommend, with \u201cthe candour of a friend,\u201d that Britons should vote to stay in the bloc.\nObama countered the anti-EU argument that Britain would gain influence and independence if it broke with Europe, writing that \u201cthe European Union doesn't moderate British influence\u2014it magnifies it.

Britons will vote on June 23 in a referendum on whether to remain in or leave the bloc. The last such referendum was in 1975, and Britons voted by nearly two to one to stay. \n  But the vote is expected to be closer in June, and some prominent British advocates of quitting the European Union have criticized Mr. Obama's intervention. London's mayor, Boris Johnson, one of the public leaders of the campaign for Britain's exit, has accused Mr. Obama of hypocrisy because the United States does not share sovereignty with its neighbors the way Britain now does with the European Union.\n  In the article, Mr. Obama responded directly to that criticism, asserting that the challenges facing Europe are not different from the ones facing the United States.\n  ''And in today's world, even as we all cherish our sovereignty, the nations who wield their influence most effectively are the nations that do it through the collective action that today's challenges demand,'' the president wrote.\n  Mr. Obama starts the first of four days in Europe on Friday by paying homage to one of its most enduring institutions, making his first visit to Windsor Castle to attend a royal lunch with Queen Elizabeth II a day after her 90th birthday.\n  But he arrives with a grim warning that he will deliver in a series of meetings with several political leaders: Europe is in danger of being pulled apart by threats to its security and economy that can be overcome only by greater cooperation and a unity that appears increasingly elusive.\n  In the article, Mr. Obama praised the creation of what he called ''international institutions and initiatives'' to promote peace and democracy, including the European Union and NATO.\n  ''Today, we face tests to this order -- terrorism and aggression; migration and economic headwinds -- challenges that can only be met if the United States and the United Kingdom can rely on one another, on our special relationship, and on the partnerships that lead to progress,'' Mr. Obama wrote.\n  Terrorist attacks like the ones in Brussels and Paris have exposed shortcomings in the gathering and sharing of intelligence that have left Europe vulnerable and scared. War in Syria, where the most recent cease-fire appears to be failing, has produced a flood of migrants that is causing political and economic turmoil in Europe.\n  The Russian-backed aggression in Ukraine has raised new questions about the effectiveness of the NATO alliance. And the vote in June threatens to cleave Britain from the European Union, potentially stalling one of the world's most successful economic powerhouses.\n  ''Because of a host of issues -- from migration to sluggish economic growth to the terrorist threat -- the European Union today faces challenges from populism and other threats to its well-being,'' said Charles Kupchan, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama for European issues. ''The E.U. is one of the great accomplishments of the post-World War II era. It has succeeded in helping remove war from Europe, and we are concerned about the health and vitality of that experiment.''\n  Mr. Obama traveled to Britain after a series of meetings in Saudi Arabia, where he said Thursday that the United States would continue to enhance security cooperation with its allies in the Persian Gulf, while encouraging them to carry out domestic reforms and bolster their ability to defend themselves.\n  During those meetings, he discussed a variety of issues with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman -- including the civil wars in Yemen, Syria and Libya, military and economic cooperation, and the fight against terrorist groups like the Islamic State. But Mr. Obama left without announcing any concrete plans or initiatives on any of those matters.\n  In a meeting planned for Friday afternoon with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, Mr. Obama will urge his counterpart to increase intelligence sharing and cooperation among European countries so that they can better counter terrorist threats, including attacks by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, aides to the president said.\n  On Sunday, Mr. Obama will discuss the Syrian migration crisis with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president's deputy national security adviser, said Mr. Obama would applaud Ms. Merkel for her efforts to absorb Syrian refugees, even at great political cost. And he will pledge United States support for the recent deal that the European Union made with Turkey to accept Syrian migrants.\n  Then on Monday, the president will meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy. Among the messages for the group will be his contention that they must take more responsibility for their own security.\n  That will be a familiar refrain to Mr. Obama's colleagues, who will recall that he made a similar -- if more blunt -- observation in a recent article in The Atlantic in which he accused some European allies of being ''free riders'' who rely on help from the United States instead of investing in their own militaries.\n  ''There's this greater sense of unraveling, if you will, of the European project,'' said Heather Conley, a former State Department official and the senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n  That concern is likely to be set aside during Mr. Obama's visit with the queen, and during his dinner on Friday night with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/world/europe/obama-urges-britain-to-remain-in-the-eu.html\nGraphic\n "}, {"id": "106", "title": "With 'candour of a friend,' Obama urges UK to stay in the EU", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-with-candour-of-a-friend-obama-urges-uk-to-stay-in-the-eu-2016-4", "time_stamp": "2016:4:21 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - President Barack Obama is urging Britons to vote to stay in the European Union, saying the challenges in the world require allies to \"stick together.\"\nIn an op-ed published in the Telegraph newspaper, Obama says Great Britain's presence in the EU \"magnifies\" Britain's influence and helps spread \"British values.\"\nThe piece was published Thursday evening as Obama arrived in London for a three-day visit.

Parliament has voted repeatedly to rule out a 'no-deal' Brexit - but it remains the default position unless a deal is approved, Brexit is canceled or the EU grants Britain another extension.\nMay says the only way to guarantee Britain does not leave the EU without a deal is for Parliament to back her deal, which lawmakers have already rejected three times.\nOn Tuesday, she said she would be prepared to compromise with her opponents - potentially pledging to keep closer ties with the bloc than she wants - in order to win their backing for the withdrawal deal.\n___\nMAY'S UNDEAD DEAL\nAfter almost two years of negotiations, Britain and the EU struck a divorce deal in November, laying out the terms of the departure from the bloc and giving a rough outline of future relations.\nBut it has been roundly rejected by lawmakers on both sides of the Brexit divide. Pro-Brexit lawmakers think it keeps Britain too closely tied to EU rules. Pro-EU legislators argue it is worse than the U.K.'s current status as an EU member.\nParliament has thrown it out three times. May's attempts to build support for the deal have so far focused on persuading pro-Brexit lawmakers to back it. But many have refused to budge.\nNow May is changing tack, saying she will talk to the opposition on compromise proposals for Britain's future relations with the bloc in a bid to get their support for the deal.\n___\nSOFT BREXIT\nMay's offer of opposition talks suggest she is pivoting to a softer form of Brexit than the one she has described for almost three years.\nMay has always insisted Britain must leave the EU's single market and customs union in order to forge new trade deals around the world - but those ideas have strong opposition support.\nIn Monday's Parliament votes on alternative Brexit proposals, a plan to keep the U.K. in an EU customs union, ensuring seamless trade in goods, was defeated by just three votes.\nTweaking her deal to adopt a customs union could gain May valuable votes in Parliament. It also would likely be welcomed by the EU and would allow Britain to leave the bloc in an orderly fashion in the next few months.\nHowever, it would also cause a schism in the Conservative Party, sparking the potential resignation of pro-Brexit government ministers.\nThat instability raises the chances of an early British election, which could rearrange Parliament and break the deadlock.\n___\nBREXIT DELAYED\nMay conceded Tuesday that Britain will need a further delay to its departure in order to sort out the mess and avert a \"no-deal\" departure.\nThe EU is frustrated with the impasse and has said it will only grant another postponement if Britain comes up with a whole new Brexit plan. Still, EU Council President Donald Tusk has urged the bloc to \"be patient\" and give Britain a Brexit extension if it plans to change course.\n___\nNEW BREXIT REFERENDUM\nParliament on Monday also narrowly rejected a proposal for a new referendum on whether to leave the EU or remain.\nThe proposal for any Brexit deal to be put to public vote in a \"confirmatory referendum\" was defeated by 12 votes. It was backed by opposition parties, plus some of May's Conservatives - mainly those who want to stay in the bloc.\nHer government has ruled out holding another referendum on Britain's EU membership, saying voters in 2016 made their decision to leave.\nBut with divisions in both Parliament and in May's Cabinet, handing the decision back to the people in a new plebiscite could be seen as the only way forward.\n___"}, {"id": "110", "title": "UK Parliament rejects alternatives to May's Brexit deal", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.apnews.com/8c0397aa2f8d48ba977073ed69921341", "time_stamp": "2019:4:2 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - Britain's Parliament has spoken - and it has said no, again.\nLawmakers seeking a way out of the country's Brexit morass on Monday rejected four alternatives to the government's unpopular European Union divorce deal that would have softened or even halted Britain's departure.\nWith just 12 days until the U.K. must come up with a new plan or crash out of the bloc in chaos, the House of Commons threw out four options designed to replace Prime Minister Theresa May's thrice-rejected Brexit deal - though in some cases by a whisker.\nThe result leaves May's Conservative government facing difficult and risky choices. It can gamble on a fourth attempt to push May's unloved deal through Parliament, let Britain tumble out of the bloc without a deal, or roll the dice by seeking a snap election to shake up Parliament.\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the government would continue to seek support for a \"credible\" plan for leaving the EU.\n\"This House has continuously rejected leaving without a deal just as it has rejected not leaving at all,\" he told lawmakers in the House of Commons after the votes. \"Therefore the only option is to find a way through which allows the U.K. to leave with a deal.\"\nMay has summoned her Cabinet for a marathon meeting Tuesday to thrash out the options. The prime minister, who is renowned for her dogged determination, could try to bring her Brexit agreement back for a fourth time later this week.\nMonday's votes revealed a preference among lawmakers for a softer form of Brexit - but not a majority to make it happen.\nThe narrowest defeat - 276 votes to 273 - was for a plan to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU, guaranteeing smooth and tariff-free trade in goods. A motion that went further, calling for Britain to stay in the EU's borderless single market for both goods and services, was defeated 282-261.\nA third proposal calling for any Brexit deal Britain strikes with the EU to be put to a public referendum was defeated 292-280.\nThe fourth, which would let Britain cancel Brexit if it came within two days of crashing out of the bloc without a deal, fell by a wider margin, 292-191.\nMay had already ruled out all the ideas under consideration. But the divorce deal she negotiated with the EU has been rejected by Parliament three times, leaving Britain facing a no-deal Brexit that could cause turmoil for people and businesses on both sides of the Channel.\nConservative lawmaker Nick Boles, architect of the single-market option, acknowledged he had failed in his attempt to break the deadlock.\n\"I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise,\" Boles added, announcing that he was quitting the Conservatives to sit as an independent in Parliament.\nThe April 12 deadline, imposed by the EU, gives Britain's politicians less than two weeks to bridge the hostile divide that separates those in her government who want to sever links with the EU and those who want to keep the ties that have bound Britain to the bloc for almost 50 years.\nLawmakers have carved out more time on Wednesday for further votes on Brexit options.\nThe impasse is raising expectations that lawmakers or the government could try to trigger a snap election in the hope a new configuration in Parliament would break the Brexit logjam. But the Conservatives are worried that could hand power to the opposition Labour Party.\nThe lack of consensus reflects a Parliament and a government deeply divided over how - and whether - to leave the EU.\nJustice Secretary David Gauke said leaving the bloc without a deal was \"not the responsible thing for a government to do.\"\nBut Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said it would be better than a soft Brexit.\n\"I don't have any fear of no-deal,\" she said.\nThe Brexit impasse has alarmed businesses, who say the uncertainty has deterred investment and undermined economic growth.\nThe chief executive of industrial manufacturer Siemens U.K. implored lawmakers to unite around a compromise deal, saying \"Brexit is exhausting our business and wrecking the country's tremendous reputation as an economic powerhouse.\"\nJuergen Maier urged lawmakers to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU, saying that would allow frictionless trade to continue. In a letter published by the Politico website, Maier said \"where the U.K. used to be beacon for stability, we are now becoming a laughing stock.\"\nEU leaders have called a special summit on April 10 to consider any request from Britain for a delay to Brexit - or to make last-minute preparations for Britain's departure without a deal two days later.\nThe European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, warned that a no-deal Brexit was looming unless Britain changed course.\n\"The House of Commons again votes against all options,\" he tweeted. \"A hard #Brexit becomes nearly inevitable. On Wednesday, the U.K. has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.\"\n___\nAssociated Press writers Gregory Katz in London and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed.\n___"}, {"id": "155", "title": "UK Parliament rejects all alternative Brexit plans (again)", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/01/uk/brexit-indicative-votes-parliament-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2019:4:1 00:00:00", "content": "UK lawmakers failed once again to find any way out of the Brexit deadlock after parliament rejected a series of alternatives to Theresa May's withdrawal deal.\nNone of the four options on the non-binding ballot, which included a confirmatory referendum and remaining in the European Union's single market, gained a majority on Monday.\nThe second or confirmatory referendum proposal had the most support among parliamentarians, with 280 votes.\nBut there were also fewer votes cast on all of the alternative Brexit options, with several abstentions.

Instead, Parliament tried to seize the steering wheel from Prime Minister Theresa May - and drove the car into the ditch.\nHouse Speaker John Bercow was asked by the chamber what would happen next.\n\"I can't say with any confidence what will happen, and, in that respect, I think I'm frankly not in a minority,\" said the loquacious keeper of order.\nThe focus now turns back again to May and whether she will put her own thrice-rejected Brexit deal to a fourth vote.\nThe British political class is facing stark choices as the clock ticks. If Parliament now does not back May's deal, it means that Britain will need to seek a long delay for Brexit or crash out with no deal at all.\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, tweeted after the votes that \"the U.K. has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.\"\nBritain has nine days - until European leaders meet at an emergency summit in Brussels - to decide how it wants to proceed.\nMonday's votes were all nonbinding, and, although all failed, several were tight.\nThe closest margin was for a compromise Brexit involving a new customs union with the European Union, failing by three votes. The proposal to require a public vote before any Brexit deal could be ratified lost by 12. Meanwhile, a proposal for a Norway-like relationship stumbled by 21. The fourth motion, seeking to effectively cancel Brexit, failed by more than a hundred ballots.\nAfterward, Nick Boles, the lawmaker pushing for the Norway-like soft Brexit, told Parliament that he was resigning as a member of the Conservative Party. \n\"I accept I have failed,\" Boles said, his voice breaking, as fellow Tories shouted out, \"Don't do it, Nick!\"\n\"I have failed, chiefly, because my party refuses to compromise,\" Boles said. \"I regret therefore to announce that I can no longer sit for this party.\"\nKenneth Clarke, a senior Conservative lawmaker who had proposed the customs-union alternative, said, \"I sometimes think that this particular Parliament that I find myself sitting in is not very political at the moment and it is confounding the general public.\"\nStephen Barclay, Britain's Brexit secretary, told the chamber that the best way forward was to support May's unloved withdrawal agreement.\n\"If the House were to agree a deal this week, it may still be possible to avoid holding European parliamentary elections,\" which are held in May, Barclay said. \"Cabinet will meet in the morning to consider the results of tonight's vote and how we should proceed.\"\nThe continued sense of drift down a river toward a waterfall, heard looming in the distance, comes amid signs that the British prime minister has lost control of Brexit, her party and her cabinet.\nThe Conservative Party is in open revolt. Over the weekend, a bloc of 170 Conservative members, including 10 cabinet ministers, wrote to May demanding that Britain leave the E.U. \"with or without a deal,\" according to the Sunday Times of London.\nHer cabinet, meanwhile, is now staffed by coup plotters and direct competitors. Hard-line Brexiteers and those ministers pushing for a softer Brexit are both threatening to resign if they do not get their way.\nThe government secretaries have become so unruly that May's chief whip, Julian Smith, in a rare on-the-record interview with the BBC, described them as the \"worst example of ill discipline in cabinet in British political history.\"\nSmith's statement was remarkable not only for what he said - but for who said it. \nChief whips are supposed to be like Victorian children in the extreme, never seen nor heard. They are virtually invisible to the world outside the Palace of Westminster, and their one and only job is to enforce party discipline - in other words, to \"whip\" their members, via text and WhatsApp group, to vote one way or another.\nSmith also said that after the results of the 2017 general election, when the Conservative Party dramatically lost its parliamentary majority, May should have been clear that the result would spell a softer kind of Brexit.\nInstead, May made bold speeches and erected red lines.\nAnd yet, May still could get her deal passed. Her supporters say it is likely that the prime minister will try a fourth time to get it through the House of Commons.\nWhy would lawmakers approve on a fourth vote that which they have rejected three times before? May's latest threat: If her Conservative members don't rally around her deal, she will call for a general election.\nThis appears an empty threat by a weakened party leader, in part because the latest opinion surveys show the opposition Labour Party polling nearly even with the Tories - despite Labour being equally divided between \"leavers\" and \"remainers.\" In that environment, it is hard to see Conservatives helping to provide the two-thirds majority required for a general election.\nLast week, May said she would step down if her deal finally, somehow, gets over the finish line, thus allowing someone else to take the reins in the second phase of Brexit negotiations with the E.U. May could be replaced as leader of the government by her party without the need for a general election. \nIn no time at all, Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary and a favorite to replace May as Conservative leader, dropped his opposition and backed May's deal.\n\"We need to get Brexit done, because we have so much more to do, and so much more that unites the Conservative party than divides us,\" Johnson wrote in Monday's Daily Telegraph, which sounded to some like a leadership bid. \n\"We have so many achievements to be proud of - and yet every single one is being drowned out in the Brexit cacophony,\" Johnson said.\nMonday's \"indicative votes\" were an effort by Parliament to find alternatives to May's deal.\nOne soft-Brexit option included a commitment to remain in a \"permanent customs union\" with the E.U. - such an arrangement allows those within the union to trade freely without tariffs but sets an external tariff on all goods coming into the bloc. Such a deal would make it hard for Britain to go global and cut its own trade deals abroad, as it would be locked into E.U. tariff regimes. But it could control European immigration.\nAnother soft-Brexit option was a Norway-style relationship that would involve staying in the E.U. single, or common, market. This path may allow Britain to seek trade deals outside the E.U. but would probably mean that Britain would have to allow free movement of E.U. citizens into Britain.\nSome Conservatives remain deeply opposed to these softer Brexits, in part because they see them as \"Brexit in name only,\" crossing all their red lines - preventing Britain from striking new trade deals with countries such as the United States and China while keeping the borders wide-open to European migrants.\nSteve Baker, a Conservative lawmaker and arch-Brexiteer, is one of those adamantly opposed to these soft-style Brexits. Before the vote, he told the BBC that joining opposition parties and supporting a vote of no confidence in the May government was \"on the table\" if the government were to adopt this path.\n\"In what do I take comfort?\" asked House Speaker Bercow on Monday after noting that none of the Brexit alternatives tried so far has gotten a majority. He mentioned that Roger Federer won the Miami Open and the Arsenal soccer club triumphed at its last match. \"So I just have to content myself with that tonight.\"\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nkarla.adam@washpost.com"}], "10": [{"id": "68", "title": "From Triumph to Trump: Online Reactions to 'Brexit'", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/triumph-trump-online-reactions-brexit-n598106", "time_stamp": "2016:6:24 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/triumph-trump-online-reactions-brexit-n598106\nThe Twitter hashtag #Brexit topped the list of trending topics.\nClick to view image\nhttp://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2016_25/1593126/160624-remain-0235_5b3ee54243ba27684144f59b5ffa120d.jpg\nROB STOTHARD\nImage: \"Remain\" supporters"}, {"id": "69", "title": "Trump: I See Parallel Between 'Brexit' and U.S.", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XRD1T-YVc8", "time_stamp": "2016:6:24 00:00:00", "content": "Donald Trump says \"I love to see people take their countries back\" and that the referendum's effects won't be known for years.\nClick to view video\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-i-see-parallel-between-brexit-and-u-s-711963715880"}, {"id": "119", "title": "Trump, in Scotland, links Brexit vote to his campaign", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://apnews.com/69835cb3eaf8484586bfa2247080da74", "time_stamp": "2016:6:24 00:00:00", "content": "AYR, Scotland (AP) - Donald Trump, in a visit to Scotland on Friday, hailed Britain's vote to leave the European Union, drawing parallels to the anger driving his own presidential campaign.\n\"I love to see people take their country back,\" he said at a news conference at one of his golf courses in Scotland. \"And that's really what's happening in the United States\" and other parts of the world.\nThe campaign leading to Thursday's stunning vote for Britain to leave the European Union shared some of the nationalist, populist themes driving Trump's campaign, including a wariness of immigration, concern about borders and skepticism of the value of multinational organizations.\n\"I think there are great similarities between happened here and my campaign,\" he said. \"People want to see borders. They don't necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don't know who they are and where they come from.\"\nTrump, whose visit to Scotland is his first international trip since becoming the prospective Republican nominee, predicted that other nations will follow Britain's lead.\n\"This will not be the last,\" he said earlier at a ceremony to mark the reopening of the Turnberry golf resort he owns on Scotland's west coast.\nTrump spent most of a 15-minute speech preceding the news conference not talking about the referendum, but offering a detailed accounting of the renovations to the course. Later, while answering questions, he played down concerns that the British economy would be hurt by the vote, suggesting his resort business could, in fact, benefit.\n\"If the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry,\" he said. \"I think it could very well turn out to be a positive.\"\nTrump said this week that he hadn't closely followed the so-called Brexit campaign but he supported the \"Leave\" movement.\nIn a tweet on arrival, Trump said Scotland \"is going wild over the vote. They took their country back.\" But Scotland had voted firmly to remain in the EU. In fact, Scotland, which voted against independence in 2014, may now hold another referendum on independence in hopes of staying in the EU. Trump said he would support Scottish independence if a vote were held.\nRival Hillary Clinton's campaign jumped on those statements and Trump's focus on his business to call his response \"dangerous and frightening.\" Clinton aides said Trump was \"rooting for economic turmoil.\"\n\"He's not concerned with foreign policy, he's not concerned with the American people,\" said Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan. \"He is concerned with himself and that's it.\"\nAt the news conference, Trump described British Prime Minister David Cameron as \"a good man\" who \"didn't get the mood of his country right.\"\nCameron wanted Britain to stay in the EU and announced Friday that he would step down.\nTrump suggested that President Barack Obama, who expressed hopes that Britain would stay in the EU, was partially responsible for the outcome, claiming that some votes were cast to spite him.\n\"If he had said no to it, I think the vote might have been different. He's constantly dictating what the world should do,\" he said.\nTrump also criticized Clinton, who sided with Obama, for \"misreading\" the situation.

Such a defeat would be hard for any prime minister to survive, but more so for May, who failed to win a majority for the Tories after a disastrous election campaign in 2017. \nOn Monday in Parliament, May instead chose the jaw- dropping humiliation of acknowledging the likely loss before it happened.\nIn doing so, she extended her tenure long enough to give it another go with European negotiators. She insisted she had negotiated the best possible Brexit deal, but she agreed to return to Brussels this week and \"do all that I can to secure the reassurances this House requires to get this deal over the line and deliver for the British people.\"\nBy delaying the vote, May also prolonged the uncertainty over Brexit - whether, come March, there is her deal, no deal or no Brexit at all.\nOn news of Brexit chaos, the pound sterling plummeted and the stock markets in the United States and Europe dipped.\nMay's retreat did little to bolster her cause in Brussels, and it remains unclear what \"reassurances\" Europe can offer to placate her domestic critics.\nE.U. leaders are exasperated by Britain's endless domestic squabbling. Most view Brexit as a self-inflicted wound, worsened by lackluster leadership. And they wonder how long such a weakened prime minister can hang on to power.\n\"We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification,\" European Council President Donald Tusk wrote on Twitter. \"As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.\"\nNeither May nor the Europeans want a no-deal Brexit, although some hard-line Brexiteers say they are willing to suffer short-term pain for long-term independence. Economists have predicted that a no-deal \"doomsday scenario\" could result in food and medicine shortages; paralyzed trade and transport, including grounded aircraft; and a possible recession in Britain.\nIn her remarks to members of Parliament on Monday, May said the \"fundamental question\" remains: \"Does this House want to deliver Brexit?\"\nSome lawmakers shouted back: \"No!\"\nSeveral members of Parliament asked whether May would resign or call for a general election.\n\"No,\" she responded.\nWhile May emphasized the need to deliver on the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum and to protect British jobs, lawmakers were upset - angry, even - that the vote was pulled. \n\"The whole House wanted to debate this, we wanted to vote on it, the people expected us to vote on it. And the government have gone and run away and hidden in the toilets,\" said Conservative Mark Francois.\n\"The government has lost control of events and is in complete disarray,\" said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party. Despite knowing that the majority of British lawmakers didn't support her deal, May \"plowed on regardless,\" Corbyn said. He added that \"bringing back the same botched deal, either next week or in January . . . will not change its fundamental flaws.\"\nHard-line Brexiteers want a clean and complete break from the European Union, while Remainers say the proposed deal would incur economic costs to Britain without sufficient benefits.\nIf May somehow manages to get better terms from the Europeans, she could return to Parliament later this month or in early January, at the latest. \nThe House of Commons Twitter feed suggested that the ultimate deadline for a meaningful vote in Parliament is March 28, the day before Britain is set to leave the E.U. May suggested that Jan. 21 was the deadline that applied.\nThat assumes she lasts that long. On the sidelines, Tory leaders have been jostling for position to replace the prime minister if she resigns or is booted out in a no-confidence vote.\nLabour leaders are hopeful for a chance to take power if a general election is called.\nMeanwhile, those who want Britain to remain in the E.U. have been looking for signs that Brexit might just go away.\nOn Monday, the E.U.'s highest court ruled that Britain could unilaterally reverse its decision to split from the 28-nation political bloc - a verdict that was expected but also gave a boost to anti-Brexit campaigners.\nThere had been a legal question about whether a reversal would require the consent of the other 27 E.U. members, but the binding decision made clear that little would stand in London's way should it decide it wanted to stay in the club. \nEuropean diplomats say they are unwilling to consider any Brexit deal that leaves open the possibility of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. That means reopening the 585-page withdrawal agreement is probably off the table - even though that is the major source of the British objections.\nThere is more flexibility to offer nonbinding assurances that the E.U. does not want to force Britain into Europe's customs union after Brexit, a key Brexiteer worry. But since those declarations would have no legal value, they might not be enough.\nIn Parliament on Monday, May struggled to make the case that preserving peace between north and south in Ireland was a promise that Britain must keep. Protestants and Catholics fought a 30-year sectarian civil war in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles.\nHere are the \"inescapable facts,\" said May. \"The fact that Northern Ireland shares a land border with another sovereign state. The fact that the hard-won peace that has been built in Northern Ireland over the last two decades has been built around a seamless border. And the fact that Brexit will create a wholly new situation: On 30 March the Northern Ireland-Ireland border will for the first time become the external frontier of the European Union's single market and customs union.\"\nThe inflexibility on the European side is in part a result of a highly successful campaign by Dublin to paint any border with Northern Ireland as a red line. Irish leaders are unwilling to countenance such a change - and the other E.U. leaders are unwilling to side with a departing member of the bloc over Ireland.\nDiplomats involved in the negotiations acknowledge that both sides' inflexibility may lead to a chaotic no-deal Brexit, with pain on either side of the English Channel - but they say giving in to British demands would also damage Europe's economy.\nMay's Brexit deal has been roundly criticized for tying Britain to E.U. rules and regulations for years to come. Hardcore Brexiteers say it would turn Britain into a \"vassal state\" and \"a rule taker versus a rulemaker,\" forever tied to Brussels but with little say. \nMay has stressed that her deal would allow Britain to control its immigration levels, which was a driving force in the Brexit vote in June 2016. But the compromise approach taken by May could limit Britain's ability to make ambitious free-trade deals outside the continental bloc, as President Trump recently asserted.\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nmichael.birnbaum@washpost.com"}, {"id": "176", "title": "Prime minister puts off Brexit deal vote", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/britains-prime-minister-delays-parliament-vote-on-brexit-deal/2018/12/10/956d27dc-f8ca-11e8-8d64-4e79db33382f_story.html", "time_stamp": "2018:12:11 00:00:00", "content": " British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday delayed Parliament's vote on her Brexit divorce deal with the European Union, admitting that lawmakers would have rejected it by a \"significant margin.\"\nThe move avoided a defeat for the government in a vote that had been scheduled for Tuesday.

They have, after all, spent months forcing the Prime Minister to go back and forth to Brussels and Strasbourg to make the changes they demanded.\nIf they don't, May's position as Prime Minister is in serious danger -- and Britain will inch towards a no-deal Brexit or, at least, face a delay to the entire process.\nLater on Tuesday, May will appeal to lawmakers in the House of Commons to back her deal -- which, she claims, is now enforced with \"legally binding\" changes designed to assuage concerns about the UK being locked into permanent arrangements with the EU and undermine Brexit.\nSpeaking alongside Juncker, after more than two hours of talks in Strasbourg last night, May insisted the changes to her deal would allow the UK to break free of the backstop -- the insurance policy mechanism in the original agreement to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland by keeping customs arrangements between the UK and Ireland aligned.\nYet pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers are deeply skeptical that the changes go far enough in protecting Brexit.\nCritics pointed to the phrase \"reduce the risk\" of the UK being locked in a permanent backstop, rather than a cast iron guarantee. There is also no fixed time limit, causing more concern among anti-EU Tory lawmakers.\nOn Tuesday, they will push for the government's most senior law chief, Geoffrey Cox, to publish his legal advice on whether the changes May has secured really are \"legally binding.\" They are also likely to seek their own legal opinion on the new documents.\nThe Northern Irish DUP party, on whose votes May normally relies to give her government a working majority in Parliament, will be decisive. If they oppose the new plans, May's Brexit deal will fail altogether -- but they could also swing many Tories against the government.\nIf May's plan fails, there will be subsequent votes later this week on whether the Commons wants to block a no deal and whether Brexit should be delayed.\nIn fact, the new documents published last night suggest Brexit could be delayed until May, before the European elections at the end of that month -- a short extension to the timetable but one which will nevertheless infuriate Euroskeptics. At that point, the Prime Minister's position will become increasingly untenable.\nHer own minister and de facto deputy David Lidington told the Commons last night that lawmakers faced a \"fundamental choice -- to vote for the improved deal or to plunge this country into a political crisis.\" And it would, indeed, be a full-blown political crisis. While May is protected until the end of the year from a leadership challenge, she may find herself with little choice but to resign if her deal fails yet again."}, {"id": "149", "title": "No deal Brexit is still possible, even if lawmakers vote against it", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/13/uk/no-brexit-possible-vote-analysis-intl-gbr/index.html", "time_stamp": "2019:3:12 00:00:00", "content": "Theresa May will have woken up Wednesday morning hoping she has won back something she lost last night: Her voice.\nHer hoarse, cracked tones in Parliament as she addressed lawmakers following yet another humiliating defeat underlined the great personal pressure the Prime Minister is under on Brexit.

This group is likely to have increased in number after Tuesday night's defeat of May's plans, with MPs now fearing that unless they vote for a no deal, Brexit itself could be delayed -- or canceled altogether.\nFor businesses, lawmakers and government officials who fear a no deal cliff-edge will damage the UK economy and cause panicked stockpiling of foods and medicines and long queues at the border, the prospect of Parliament actively voting for this scenario is very worrying indeed.\nThe Prime Minister, unsurprisingly, will vote against a no deal. And yet, regardless of the outcome of Wednesday's vote, Britain is heading for a no deal Brexit anyway -- because that is the default position, unless a deal can be agreed by both Brussels and the UK parliament.\nIn one sense, after Tuesday night's so-called meaningful vote, Wednesday's is the meaningless vote.\nDelaying Brexit\nThe only way lawmakers can now stop a no deal is for one or more of three things to happen: May's plan to pass in another vote, for a different exit plan to be backed by a majority of the Commons, or for Parliament to pass a motion to delay Brexit.\nThe first of these options would involve yet another meaningful vote -- following one back in January, in which May's plans were defeated by a majority of 230, and the vote last night, featuring a tweaked version of her original withdrawal agreement, containing additional legal language on the Irish backstop.\nIt is possible, although not likely, that the Prime Minister will wait until closer to exit day, when the Commons is running out of alternative options, to present her plans for a third time.\nBut, given the appetite among her Brexiteer lawmakers for a no deal, it is very unlikely this would pass.\nAnd given May's strategy of presenting Parliament with an ultimatum -- of her deal or no deal -- has effectively failed, this tactic to further run down the clock will enrage MPs who already think she should step down as Prime Minister.\nWhat is more likely is one or both of the second and third of these options.\nA vote to delay Brexit is expected Thursday, and will be a close-run thing.\nCrucially, however, both a new deal and a delay would need approval from Brussels in order for them to change the course of Brexit.\nNext week, EU leaders are gathering for the last summit before Britain's departure date -- so UK lawmakers would need to agree a position before then.\nOn Tuesday night, MPs from different parties and factions began to table amendments to Wednesday night's no deal motion in order to make the vote have some force.\nThere are still moves afoot for a second referendum, which could pave the way for Brexit to be canceled altogether."}, {"id": "150", "title": "Brexit vote: Theresa May's deal overwhelmingly crushed by lawmakers for second time", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/12/uk/theresa-may-brexit-deal-vote-main-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2019:3:12 00:00:00", "content": "British lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal for a second time, plunging the UK into a further period of political uncertainty with the departure date from the European Union a mere 17 days away.\nDespite May's hoarse-voiced pleas in the House of Commons for lawmakers to support her draft exit deal on Tuesday, or run the risk of a chaotic exit from the EU or no Brexit at all, lawmakers crushed it by 391 votes to 242.\nThe margin of defeat was less than the historic loss suffered by the government when the deal was originally voted on in January.\nMay had hoped that changes to her deal agreed last minute on Monday night with the EU would get it across the line.\nThe coming days will be chaotic and unpredictable as lawmakers vote on whether to crash out of the EU without a deal entirely, or to delay the divorce process.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons after the defeat, the Prime Minister told lawmakers she \"profoundly regrets\" the vote against her deal. \"The deal we have negotiated is the best and indeed the only deal available.\"\nMay has offered her MPs a free vote on Wednesday on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal on March 29.\nIf a no deal is rejected, the House of Commons will vote on an extension to the March 29 withdrawal date.\n\"But let me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face,\" she said.\n\"This House will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke Article 50?

Or does it want to leave with a deal but not this deal?\n\"These are unenviable choices, but thanks to the decision the House has made this evening they must now be faced,\" she said.\nNo deal looms\nBut EU officials have warned that rejecting May's withdrawal agreement has raised the stakes for a hard Brexit.\n\"With only 17 days left to 29 March, today's vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a 'no-deal' Brexit,\" the spokesman for European Council President Donald Tusk told CNN.\n\"We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be ready if such a scenario arises.\"\nQuestions also remain over May's political future. Ahead of Tuesday's vote, some members of the ruling Conservative party called for the Prime Minister to trigger a general election should her Brexit deal fail.\nAnother possible outcome could be a second referendum, which has been called for by a minority of lawmakers from all parties.\nBut opposition Labour leader, and longstanding euroskeptic, Jeremy Corbyn did not push for another Brexit referendum in his address to the Commons on Tuesday, despite his party's official position of backing a second vote on the issue.\nNor is there any majority in Commons for any specific kind of Brexit -- let alone a second referendum.\nThe mad dash\nMay's withdrawal deal crumbled due to a contentious guarantee, known as the Irish backstop, to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland by keeping customs arrangements between the UK and Ireland aligned.\nThe backstop has been a bone of contention with many British euroskeptic lawmakers, who feared it would indefinitely bind the UK closer to the EU's rules.\nThe Prime Minister's attempt to gain concessions from Brussels over the backstop led to a last minute dash to Strasbourg on Monday -- where she secured changes to her deal.\nBut hopes to swing the tide of dissent to her deal suffered a blow by the UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who said the risk of the UK being trapped in the backstop remained unchanged.\nHis opinion was followed by the pound dropping sharply on Tuesday; and likely influenced euroskeptic lawmakers who were mulling on how to vote later in the day.\nHours before the vote, the 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party [DUP], which props up May's minority government, announced that it would not back May's deal.\nFormer foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is a prominent Brexiteer, told Parliament on Tuesday: \"I am afraid this deal has now reached the end of the road and if it is rejected tonight I hope that it will be put to bed.\""}, {"id": "151", "title": "No deal Brexit rejected by British lawmakers", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/13/uk/no-deal-brexit-british-parliament-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2019:3:13 00:00:00", "content": "British lawmakers have decisively rejected a no-deal Brexit, inflicting another heavy defeat on Britain's embattled Prime Minister and paving a way for the UK's departure from the EU to be delayed.\nThe UK Parliament declared Theresa May should reject the option of leaving the European Union without a deal in any circumstances, in a motion that was worded more strongly than she had proposed.\nLawmakers will now vote on Thursday to decide whether Brexit should be postponed beyond the current March 29 deadline.\nWednesday's vote, carried by 321 to 278, doesn't change the default legal position, which is that without a deal, or unless the EU agrees to delay Brexit, Britain crashes out in just over two weeks. Such a prospect raises the threat of food shortages in supermarkets, port delays, and a rise in long-simmering tensions in Northern Ireland.\nMay told the House of Commons that it would face important choices in the coming days. \"The legal default in UK and EU law remains that the UK will leave the EU without a deal unless something else is agreed,\" she said after the vote.\nShe said that the government would ask the EU to delay Brexit if Parliament could agree on a withdrawal deal. \"If the House finds a way in the coming days to support a deal, it would allow the government to seek a short technical extension. Such a short technical extension is only likely to be on offer if there's a deal in place.\"\nWithout consensus on a deal in the coming days, there will need to be a longer extension which would force the UK to take part in elections to the European Parliament in May, she said. \"I do not think that would be the right outcome,\" the Prime Minister told lawmakers.\nThe prospect of the UK Parliament backing May's withdrawal deal seems remote. Lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected it for a second time on Tuesday, furious about a contentious guarantee, known as the Irish backstop.\nThe backstop is intended to prevent the return of border infrastructure in Northern Ireland by keeping customs arrangements between the UK and the Republic of Ireland aligned. But euroskeptic lawmakers feared it would indefinitely bind the UK closer to the EU's rules.\nHardening mood\nAny request by the UK to delay Brexit must be agreed by Brussels. But the mood has been hardening among European politicians, who seem reluctant to reopen negotiations for a withdrawal deal or grant a delay to Brexit without any specific purpose.\nEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told Members of the European Parliament on Wednesday that the ball was firmly in London's court. \"It is UK's responsibility to tell us what they want for our future relations. That is the question that needs to be posed to which we expect an answer. It will be a priority even before the question of an extension. Negotiations on Article 50 are finished,\" he said.\nThe EU noted that Wednesday's vote had no legal effect. \"To take no deal off the table, it is not enough to vote against no deal -- you have to agree to a deal\", an EU spokesperson said.\n\"We have agreed a deal with the Prime Minister and the EU is ready to sign it,\" the spokesperson added. \"There are only two ways to leave the EU: with or without a deal. The EU is prepared for both.\"\nDivided house\nAs it stands, there seems to be no consensus in the House of Commons for any kind of Brexit.\nOne possible route is a third vote on May's withdrawal deal. May indicated as much at the House of Commons on Wednesday. \"I want to leave the EU with a good deal, I believe we have a good deal,\" May, who is battling a cold, said.\n\"I may not have my own voice, but I understand the voice of the country.\"\nThere were chaotic scenes in the House of Commons on Wednesday. May first promised her own Conservative party a free vote on whether to reject no-deal. But the wording of her motion was ambiguous and referred only to March 29.\nBut MPs agreed a tougher amendment, ruling out no deal in any circumstances. When the full amended motion came back for a final vote, Conservative MPs were directed to reject it.\nA number of cabinet ministers, including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Scottish Secretary David Mundell, abstained from voting. It is unclear whether they will be asked to resign.\nPro-EU lawmakers are pushing for a second referendum on Brexit. But the House of Commons doesn't seem ready to take that route either. Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour leader, a longstanding euroskeptic, has still not embraced the cause of a so-called People's Vote, declining to advocate it when he addressed the Commons after May's withdrawal deal was defeated on Tuesday.\nThere are questions about whether May can survive the turmoil -- and whether the deadlock can only be broken by a general election.\nAs the clock ticks towards withdrawal day, business groups expressed dire warnings."}, {"id": "182", "title": "Parliament rejects May's new Brexit plan", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/british-parliament-to-vote-tuesday-on-theresa-mays-new-brexit-plan-but-the-tweaked-deal-faces-strong-opposition/2019/03/12/850e2c52-4405-11e9-94ab-d2dda3c0df52_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:3:13 00:00:00", "content": "Second defeat imperils leader, leaves 2 choices: Delay or no deal\nLONDON - Three years after Britain voted to leave the European Union, lawmakers have failed to agree on how to do it.\nParliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's revised Brexit deal Tuesday in a vote of 391 to 242, the second time she has suffered such an overwhelming defeat.\nLast-minute negotiations with E.U. leaders were not enough to secure the support of hard-liners in the prime minister's Conservative Party - 75 Tories voted against their leader.\nThe loss raises questions not only about May's authority but also about how Britain will exit the trading bloc. With just over two weeks before the Brexit deadline, the options are narrowing.\nParliament will vote Wednesday on whether to leave the European Union on schedule, on March 29, without a deal - a scenario that could create economic havoc for Britain and, to a lesser degree, Europe.\nBoris Johnson, the former foreign secretary and a leading Brexiteer, argued in favor of a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday. While acknowledging \"that is in the short term the more difficult road,\" he said, \"in the end, it's the only safe route out of the abyss and the only safe path to self-respect.\"\nBut there doesn't seem to be the stomach in Parliament for it. More likely, lawmakers will push to keep trying for a managed withdrawal. In that case, they will vote Thursday on whether to request a delay from leaders of the European Union's remaining 27 member states.\nEuropean leaders have suggested they would grant a delay but have warned their patience is not infinite.\nEurope \"will expect a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration,\" said a spokesman for European Council President Donald Tusk. \"The smooth functioning of the E.U. institutions will need to be ensured.\"\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters after meeting with May in Strasbourg, France, on Monday night that the union was not willing to reopen talks. \"There will be no new negotiations,\" he said.\nMay also seemed to have reached her limit on talks. Her voice was nearly gone on Tuesday - a spokesman blamed a bad cold. \"I profoundly regret the decision that this House has taken tonight,\" May conceded.\nMay said Conservative lawmakers would not be whipped to vote one way or another on whether to leave with or without a deal - that Wednesday would be a \"free vote,\" meaning lawmakers don't have to adhere to party lines.\nShe noted that while leaving without a deal is the default legal position, she and her government would prefer \"an orderly Brexit.\"\n\"Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face,\" she added. \"The E.U. will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension, and this House will have to answer that question.\"\n\"Does it wish to revoke Article 50?\" May asked the House of Commons, meaning no Brexit? \"Does it want to hold a second referendum? Does it want to leave with a deal but not this deal?\"\nMay has said previously that if an extension beyond March 29 were necessary, it would be granted only once by the European Union, and that it shouldn't go beyond the end of June.\nAnti-Brexit lawmakers hope that if Britain's departure is delayed, momentum will build for a second referendum - a do-over - to ask voters whether they really want to leave.\nAlthough the opposition Labour Party has endorsed a second referendum, there does not appear to be majority support for it in Parliament.\n\"There isn't actually evidence that the British people have changed their minds,\" May said to lawmakers Tuesday. \"And where would it end? So what? So you have another referendum, and there's a different result, and then everybody says, well, let's actually have a third one.\"\nSpeculation was rife about what would happen to May now.\nHer supporters say the prime minister crafted a sensible compromise, the best that the European Union is going to offer. It would get Britain out of the bloc, control borders and end free movement of E.U. citizens into Britain - while protecting the Good Friday accords that brought peace to Northern Ireland.\nBut the prime minister's strategy has been resisted by lawmakers who want to reverse Brexit and by those who want to leave with no deal and make a clear break.\nSome want a softer Brexit, others a harder Brexit. The Northern Irish unionists who prop up May's government want to remain close to the United Kingdom. The Scottish nationalists want to remain close to Europe.\nMay told lawmakers they should not blame the European Union for the impasse, only themselves.\nMany in the House of Commons, though, blame May, who has a reputation for being determined but lacking oratory prowess and vision.\nCharles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, predicted Parliament would take greater control of the Brexit process and push for a softer withdrawal. That could split the Conservative Party and produce a renewed attempt to oust May from Downing Street, he said.\n\"In such circumstances, it's possible that the right wing of her party would try and bring her down in the hope of installing a different Tory leader,\" he said.\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said May had \"run down the clock\" and her deal was \"clearly dead.\"\n\"It's time that we have a general election, and the people can choose who their government should be,\" he said.\nCharles Walker, a Conservative Party politician, told the BBC that if May's deal was rejected, \"as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks.\"\nAhead of Tuesday's vote, May told Parliament that she had secured the \"legally binding\" assurances they sought from the European Union that would guarantee Britain won't be \"indefinitely\" tied to European rules and regulations, even if the sides cannot agree in the future on how else to keep the border on the island of Ireland free and open.\nBut an opinion from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox proved devastating.\nCox said May's tweaked deal did \"reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained within the protocol's provisions,\" but he warned that \"the legal risk remains unchanged.\" Cox said Britain would have \"no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol's arrangements, save by agreement\" with the Europeans.\nCox's assessment helped influence Brexit hard-liners and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to vote against the deal.\nIn Brussels and across Europe, the mood was black following the vote, with many leaders warning publicly that they were stepping up their preparations for a chaotic, no-deal Brexit and some warning privately that they were completely serious - despite British assumptions that an extension to the departure deadline will be granted more or less automatically if they ask for one.\n\"Deeply saddened by the outcome of the #Brexit vote this evening,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen tweeted. \"Despite clear EU-assurances on the backstop, we now face a chaotic #NoDeal #Brexit scenario.

The wishes expressed by lawmakers do not tie the hands of the British government, nor do they commit the E.U. to any action.\nPrime Minister Theresa May conceded there was a \"clear majority\" against a no-deal Brexit, but she warned lawmakers that the \"legal default\" was that Britain would still leave without a deal on March 29 unless another agreement is reached. \nMay said her government could ask the E.U. for a short extension to implement a deal if it passed by next week. If no deal is passed, May said she would be forced to seek a much longer delay.\nThe prime minister was, in essence, alerting, even threatening, lawmakers that if they do not agree to some kind of Brexit deal fast - namely hers, which has been rejected twice, or some other compromise still to be crafted - then Brexit will  drift into the far future.\nMay said: \"If the House finds a way in the coming days to support a deal, it would allow the government to seek a short limited technical extension . . . to provide time to pass the necessary legislation and ratify the agreement we have reached with the E.U. But let me be clear, such a short technical extension is only likely to be on offer if we have a deal in place.\"\nShe continued that if the British Parliament \"is not willing to support a deal in the coming days, and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March, then it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension.\"\nA delay of any length would need approval by leaders of the other 27 E.U. member states, who have repeatedly said they want a clear plan of action from Britain.\n\"It is a signal of rationality that has just come from London,\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted. \"But now is the time for the British to say what exactly they want to bring the Brexit deal to a successful conclusion. Because time is running out.\"\nA longer delay would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections in May. \"I do not think that would be the right outcome,\" May said. \"But the House needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions it has taken.\"\n\"If Parliament votes repeatedly to say 'the moon is made of cheese,' it doesn't mean the moon is made of cheese,\" said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. \"Parliament can say, repeatedly, that they don't want no-deal, but the legal reality is that no-deal will happen unless they vote for something else to happen.\"\nLiam Fox, the international trade secretary, warned Parliament that an extension is not a gift. \"And it is not clear what price the E.U. might extract for an extension,\" he said.\nEuropean leaders have grown anxious that May is losing her authority and her way, fighting against a raucous, divided Parliament and increasingly assertive Conservative Party rebels who want to leave the European Union with no deal.\nThe chief E.U. Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, asked aloud why there should be any further discussion with Britain or an extension of the departure date. He said that nearly three years of talks had reached their end.\n\"Why would we extend these discussions?\" he asked the European Parliament. The negotiations, he said, are \"done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement. It's there.\"\nBarnier warned British lawmakers that they were bringing their state to the brink, whether they liked it or not. \"We are at a critical point. The risk of a no-deal has never been higher,\" he said. \"I urge you, please, not to underestimate that risk or its consequences.\"\nMany hardcore Brexiteers, while a minority of the overall Parliament, embrace the idea of \"no-deal\" Brexit.\n\"I hope that Parliament will vote not to take no-deal off the table,\" Conservative lawmaker Boris Johnson told the BBC before the vote.\nJohnson, one of the favorites to replace May, said: \"It's crazy to disable yourself as you go into a negotiation. . . . why would we shoot ourselves in the foot like that?\"\nMay clearly hopes to put pressure on those Brexiteers who previously voted against her deal but who shudder at the thought of a long delay - or possibly losing Brexit altogether.\nStill, some hard-liners said they would press on voting against May's plan.\nSteve Baker, the deputy chairman of the influential European Research Group, said that he would \"keep voting this down however many times it is brought back.\"\nIf all hope for a deal crumbles, May could resign, or she could pivot and call for a snap election.\nOr Parliament could demand another Brexit referendum.\nAfter warning the House about the perils of no-deal, Exchequer Phillip Hammond said May's government and lawmakers should \"start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this house for a deal we can collectively support to exit the E.U. in an orderly way\" - suggesting moves toward a softer Brexit.\nWhile the chaos in London rattled other European capitals, there was also some satisfaction that the British Parliament appeared to fear a no-deal Brexit as much as Europe does and might favor a softer or more gradual departure.\n\"An extension is better than no deal,\" said Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, speaking in Washington a day ahead of planned meetings with President Trump and Vice President Pence. If Britain decided to reconsider its \"red lines,\" Varadkar added, they'd receive a \"very generous, very warm and very open response\" from E.U. member states.\nIn Brussels, E.U. ambassadors gathered to plot their next moves. Most countries appeared willing to accept some sort of delay. But there were disagreements about what Britain would have to promise in order to receive an extension.\nMay's domestic brinkmanship gives little time for E.U. leaders to lay the diplomatic groundwork for their response ahead of a two-day summit that begins March 21. Some groused that proposals that could set off E.U.-wide earthquakes typically get aired at least a few days in advance. And although most European leaders would welcome a Brexit reversal, the necessary consensus for a long delay is less clear.\nSome E.U. policymakers watched with amazement at Wednesday's maneuvers in the House of Commons, noting the energy being expended on the  \"Malthouse Compromise\" - a proposal the E.U. sees as the British attempting to preserve the divorce deal while stripping out the parts that would guarantee an open Irish border. It was roundly defeated.\nBrexiteers have been accused of chasing unicorns, conjuring up magical solutions to complex situations like the Irish border problem.\nThat may have been what the European Union Council President Donald Tusk - known for setting off social media - had in mind when he posted a child's unicorn drawing on his Instagram account.\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nkarla.adam@washpost.com\nmichael.birnbaum@washpost.com"}], "54": [{"id": "91", "title": "British PM May blasts Parliament for Brexit mess as deadline looms", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/brexit-mess-british-pm-theresa-may-blasts-parliament-deadline-looms-n985451", "time_stamp": "2019:3:20 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/brexit-mess-british-pm-theresa-may-blasts-parliament-deadline-looms-n985451\nUnless Britain and the E.U. agree on an alternative solution, Britain will leave the bloc on March 29 without a deal in place.\nClick to view image\nhttps://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2019_12/2793331/190320-theresa-may-ew-454p_550e7f0579a123375a18c2da2d208428.jpg\nJonathan Brady\nImage:"}, {"id": "139", "title": "UK lawmakers to vote on requesting delay as Brexit day nears", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/uk-lawmakers-to-vote-on-requesting-delay-as-brexit-day-nears", "time_stamp": "2019:3:13 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - British lawmakers have gone on record saying they don't want the U.K. to leave the European Union without a divorce agreement in place, increasing the odds that Brexit won't take place as planned at the end of the month.\nWith the approaching deadline intensifying fears that economic and personal turmoil might follow a \"no-deal\" withdrawal by Britain, Parliament voted 321-278 Wednesday to rule out the possibility.\nHowever, Prime Minister Theresa May and the European Union noted the decision wasn't legally binding. She offered the House of Commons a chance to try to stop the countdown to a March 29 departure.\nA look at what might happen:\n___\nDELAY, DELAY, DELAY\nNow that the House of Commons gave leaving the EU without an agreement a thumbs down, it is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to ask the EU to delay Brexit by up to three months.\nThis option is likely to prove popular, since politicians on both sides of the Brexit debate fear time is running out to secure an orderly withdrawal by March 29.\nExtending the timeframe for Brexit requires approval from all 27 remaining EU member countries. They have an opportunity to grant such a request at a March 21-22 summit in Brussels.\nBut the rest of the EU is reluctant to postpone Brexit beyond the late May elections for the EU's legislature. The U.K. won't be represented in the European Parliament after it quits the EU; its seats already have been given to other countries to fill in the elections.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, one of the EU's strongest supporters, said Wednesday that a request for a postponement would be considered, but not granted automatically.\nMacron said the British government has \"to explain to us what the point of it is, and in particular whether it adds anything.\"\n___\nCONTINUING CRISIS\nWhatever Parliament decides this week, it won't end Britain's Brexit crisis. Both lawmakers and the public remain split between backers of a clean break from the EU and those who favor continuing a close relationship, either through a post-Brexit trade deal or by reversing the June 2016 decision to leave.\nMay also is unwilling to abandon her hard-won deal with the EU on Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with the bloc. Parliament voted it down twice, and May might try to put it to a third vote.\nShe told lawmakers after the passed the non-binding motion rejecting a no-deal Brexit they are down to two choices: approving a withdrawal agreement in coming days and asking the EU for a short delay, or requesting a \"much longer\" extension in hopes of negotiating a new arrangement.\nThe prime minister warned that a long extension would mean Britain would have to take part in the European elections. May said the House of Commons had to \"face up\" to the consequences of its decisions.\nSome think the only way forward is a snap election that could rearrange the forces in Parliament and break the political deadlock. May has ruled that out, but could come to see it as her only option.\nAnd anti-Brexit campaigners haven't abandoned the idea of a new referendum on remaining in the EU. The government opposes the idea, which at the moment also lacks majority support in Parliament.\nHowever, the political calculus could change if the paralysis drags on. The opposition Labour Party has said it would support a second referendum if other options were exhausted.\n___"}, {"id": "152", "title": "British lawmakers approve Brexit delay but reject second referendum", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/14/uk/article-50-extension-second-brexit-referendum-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2019:3:14 00:00:00", "content": "UK lawmakers have voted in favor of delaying the Brexit process, acknowledging that more time is needed to break the deadlock over Britain's departure from the EU.

Unless a delay is approved by all 27 remaining EU leaders, Britain is heading for a chaotic exit on March 29.\nMay had reluctantly agreed to support a delay, after the House of Commons overwhelmingly rejected her imperiled withdrawal deal earlier this week. However, her offer is conditional on Parliament approving her plan when she puts it before MPs for a third time next week. She faces a monumental effort to turn around the huge opposition to the deal within her own party.\nMPs approved her plan to postpone Brexit by 412 votes to 202. But in a sign of the divisions that continue to plague her Conservative Party, eight Cabinet ministers and 188 of her MPs -- more than half her parliamentary bloc -- voted against it.\nMinutes after wrapping up the debate for the government, in which he urged Parliament to support the delay, her Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay did exactly the opposite. It was a striking act of defiance by the Cabinet minister responsible for delivering the Prime Minister's Brexit strategy.\nIn a rare moment of victory for Britain's embattled leader, May saw off a proposal for Parliament to take greater control of the Brexit process. A plan for MPs to seize control of parliamentary business next week, in order to vote on alternative Brexit plans, was rejected by two votes.\nShe was also buoyed by an emphatic defeat for supporters of a second Brexit referendum. MPs voted 334 to 85 against a second vote, after the opposition Labour Party told its MPs to abstain.\nHuge battle ahead\nMay still faces a huge battle to overturn Tuesday's 149-strong majority against her deal. She must persuade 75 MPs to change their minds if she is to avoid further attempts by MPs to force an alternative Brexit plan on her government.\nThe Prime Minister has warned that, if MPs reject her deal a third time, a longer delay to Brexit will be required. That would force the UK to take part in elections to the European Parliament in May, and to continue paying in to the EU budget.\nThe threat of an extended delay to the UK's departure could help focus minds among Brexit-supporting lawmakers, including the 10 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) members who prop up her ruling Conservative Party.\nMay also hopes that her Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, can give further reassurances on the most contentious part of the deal, the so-called Irish backstop. There is no prospect of the EU agreeing to any changes to the deal.\nSour mood in Brussels\nMore than two years since Britain voted to leave the EU, its politicians are as divided as ever on how to move forward with Brexit.\nThe lack of clarity has soured the mood in Brussels. Some EU leaders have indicated their wariness to grant May an extension or renegotiate her deal.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday any extension to Brexit could only be \"a technical delay to allow more time to put their departure in place.\"\nMacron, who is currently in Kenya, added that the UK would need a purpose for the EU to grant any extension, so as \"to ensure something will come out of it.\"\nBut European Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter that he would appeal to the 27 EU leaders \"to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it.\""}], "57": [{"id": "92", "title": "Britain granted short Brexit delay, won't leave European Union next week", "publisher": "NBCNEWS.com", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/britain-granted-short-brexit-delay-won-t-leave-european-union-n986106", "time_stamp": "2019:3:22 00:00:00", "content": "Click to view full-text\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/britain-granted-short-brexit-delay-won-t-leave-european-union-n986106\nThe U.K. has been granted a bit more time in figuring out the terms of its departure from the European trading bloc.\nClick to view image\nhttps://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2019_12/2795046/190321-theresa-may-eu-brexit-delay-ac-713p_bab5bec8963bfff93fd5803e9e1800fa.jpg\nYves Herman\nImage: Theresa may, European Union leaders summit in Brussels\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel and Britain's Permanent Representative to the EU Tim Barrow attend a European Union leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium on March 21, 2019.\nClick to view image\nhttps://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2019_12/2795046/190321-theresa-may-eu-brexit-delay-ac-713p_bab5bec8963bfff93fd5803e9e1800fa.jpg\nYves Herman\nImage: Theresa may, European Union leaders summit in Brussels"}], "61": [{"id": "93", "title": "British Prime Minister Theresa May to resign amid Brexit turmoil", "publisher": "NBC News NBC NIGHTYLY NEWS", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/british-prime-minister-theresa-may-to-resign-amid-brexit-turmoil-60295749691", "time_stamp": "2019:5:24 00:00:00", "content": "KATE SNOW (00:12:03): Overseas, Britain`s prime minister finally gave up today on the struggle to get her Brexit plan approved and on any hope that she could remain in power.

The new party leader will become prime minister without the need for a general election.\nShe became prime minister the month after the U.K. voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, and her premiership has been consumed by the attempt to deliver on that verdict.\nMay was brought down by Brexit, but her nemesis wasn't the EU, with which she successfully struck a divorce deal.\nShe was felled by her own Conservative Party, which refused to accept it. The plan was defeated three times in Parliament, rejected both by pro-EU opposition lawmakers and by Brexit-supporting Conservatives who thought it kept Britain too closely bound to the bloc.\nMany Conservative lawmakers came to see May as an obstacle and blamed her for the U.K.'s failure to leave the EU on the scheduled date of March 29. The bloc has extended that deadline until Oct. 31 in hope Britain's politicians can break their political deadlock.\nThe pressure on May reached breaking point this week as House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom quit and several Cabinet colleagues rejected the bill she planned to put before Parliament in a fourth attempt to secure lawmakers' backing for her Brexit blueprint.\nIn her farewell speech, May defended her record, saying she had \"negotiated the terms of our exit and a new relationship with our closest neighbors that protects jobs, our security and our Union.\"\n\"I have done everything I can to convince MPs to back that deal,\" she said. \"Sadly, I have not been able to do so.\"\n\"It is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort,\" she added.\nMultiple contenders are already jockeying to replace her in a contest that will see a new leader chosen by Conservative lawmakers and party members. The early front-runner is Boris Johnson, a former foreign secretary and strong champion of Brexit. Other contenders are likely to include Leadsom, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab.\nJohnson, whose relentless criticism helped push May out of the door, tweeted: \"Thank you for your stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party. It is now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit.\"\nWhether it is Johnson or another contender, the next prime minister is likely to be a staunch Brexiteer, who will try to renegotiate the divorce deal, and if that fails, to leave the bloc without an agreement on the terms of the departure.\n\"The person who will replace her will embrace the possibility of a no deal with alacrity rather than fear,\" said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. \"They will have to embrace it if they want to be elected by the Tory party membership.\"\nMost businesses and economists think that would cause economic turmoil and plunge Britain into recession. Parliament has voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit, though it remains the legal default option.\nBut many Conservatives think embracing a no-deal Brexit may be the only way to keep the support of voters who opted in 2016 to leave the EU.\nThe Conservatives expect to take a bruising when results come in late Sunday from this week's European Parliament election, which many British voters are expected to use to express displeasure over the political gridlock. Opinion polls suggest Conservative voters deserting in droves to the single-issue Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage.\nAny attempt to take Britain out of the EU without a deal will be fiercely resisted by Parliament, and could see pro-Europeans leave the Conservative Party.\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, an opponent of Brexit, tweeted that May's exit \"will not solve the Brexit mess that the Tories have created. ... The prospect of an even more hard-line Brexiteer now becoming PM and threatening a no deal exit is deeply concerning.\"\nEU leaders expressed respect for May, and stressed they would not renegotiate the Brexit deal.\n\"We have set out our position on the withdrawal agreement and on the political declaration,\" said EU spokeswoman Mina Andreeva.\nShe said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had great respect for May and would\u00a0\"equally respect and establish working relations\" with any new British leader.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would continue to \"do everything it can to ensure there is a good partnership with Britain, an orderly exit, and then continuing good cooperation.\"\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has sometimes differed publicly with May, said he was \"feeling badly\" for her.\n\"I like her very much,\" said Trump who is due to meet May on a state visit to Britain June 3-5.\nAnd May departed with a warning to her successor.\n\"To succeed, he or she will have to find consensus in Parliament where I have not,\" she said. \"Such a consensus can only be reached if those on all sides of the debate are willing to compromise.\"\nShe said it had been \"the honor of my life\" to serve as Britain's leader, the second woman to hold the job, after Margaret Thatcher.\n\"The second female prime minister - but certainly not the last,\" May said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Gregory Katz in London, Raf Casert in Brussels and David Rising in Berlin contributed.\n___"}, {"id": "186", "title": "No-deal Brexit looks likelier as May steps down", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/what-happens-next-with-brexit-now-that-theresa-may-is-resigning/2019/05/24/48bf3306-7e2d-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:5:26 00:00:00", "content": "Her replacement could see crashing out of E.U. as only means to deliver\nBERLIN - On one side of the English Channel, supporters see it as the greatest peace project the world has ever known.\nBut seen from that sceptered isle drifting scarcely 20 miles out at sea, the European Union looks more like a political assassin, one with a particularly rapacious appetite for British prime ministers.\nThe E.U. claimed its fourth victim in the past three decades on Friday, as a choked-up Theresa May announced that, having failed to get Britain out of the bloc, she would resign as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7 and make way for a new Conservative prime minister this summer. Three of her predecessors have also been evicted from Downing Street while trying to crack the code of Europe. \nNow, a growing list of Conservative politicians are jockeying to replace her. Each has promised to end the impasse that has left Britain stuck in the nether region between E.U. membership and life on the outside. But if May's successor is to avoid the same fate, analysts say, he or she may have little choice but to steer Britain toward what was once seen as a remote possibility but is increasingly viewed as a live prospect: a chaotic departure from the E.U. with no agreement on what comes next.\n\"A no-deal Brexit has become significantly more likely,\" said Steven Fielding, a politics professor at the University of Nottingham. \"Whoever follows May will be faced with an existential threat. They'll think, 'If I don't deliver Brexit, I'm finished.' \"\nIf Britain does jump into the post-E.U. world without a net, the impact would shake Britain's economy - with ripples, and perhaps waves, far beyond its shores. \nAnd yet several of May's would-be successors have already argued in favor of that option, reasoning that Britain's journey to freedom from the shackles of the E.U. begins with a departure on its own terms, rather than a compromise.\nBoris Johnson, the former foreign secretary and front-runner to succeed May, highlighted the possibility on Friday, telling an economics conference in Switzerland that his country would \"leave the E.U. on 31 October, deal or no deal.\" (Halloween is the next in a series of deadlines since Britain's vote to exit nearly three years ago.)\nOf course, that could be a bluff. Johnson acknowledged as much, adding that \"the way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no-deal.\"\nEuropean policymakers love to loathe the list of ardent Brexiteers now aiming to succeed May at 10 Downing Street. They reserve particular disdain for Johnson, whom they remember from his days whipping up hostility toward the E.U. as a Brussels-based correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. Johnson and his fellow Brexiteers have spent three years advocating negotiating positions that are unrealistic given European demands and pressures, Brussels diplomats say.\n\"There are some in London who think they can negotiate another deal,\" said Rosa Balfour, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. \"That's not going to happen. They've already got the best deal they're going to get. The red lines will not change.\"\nMay found that out the hard way. She repeatedly pressed her European counterparts to give her more beyond the compromise withdrawal deal she struck with them, so she could sell Parliament on the deal.\nBut she failed to get further meaningful concessions from Europe. And her fractious Parliament rejected the deal three times. May resigned rather than face the indignity of a fourth defeat.\nWith E.U. leaders insisting there will be no new negotiation, it is not clear how May's successor can follow through on Brexit other than by departing with no deal or fundamentally changing Britain's negotiating stance.\nMay's downfall follows that of David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, all of whom found themselves unable to unite the country - and, perhaps most critical, their party - behind a common position on Europe. \n\"The Conservative Party has been almost fatally divided on this issue since the 1980s,\" Fielding said. \"Successive party leaders have struggled to manage the divisions, and all of them have failed. The Conservative Party's problem has now become the British problem.\" \nConservatives will choose a new leader - and a new prime minister - over the next two months. Whoever wins the job will face the most daunting challenge yet in holding the party together. An expected drubbing in European Parliamentary elections at the hands of the Nigel Farage-led Brexit Party, which did not exist several months ago, will underline just how close the Conservatives are to cracking up, Fielding said. And it will probably embolden those on the right of the party who are pushing for an exit at any cost.\nA Prime Minister Johnson also might have very different priorities than the woman he would replace.\n\"May's overriding goal,\" Balfour said, \"was to save the Tory Party.\"\nJohnson, by contrast, may not care about bridging divides that have grown into a deep chasm. Like President Trump in the United States, he sees himself as an iconoclastic politician who can dominate by satisfying a base, rather than appeasing disparate factions.\nLittle will be clear before late October, Europeans expect, because they don't think British lawmakers will make any difficult decisions without a deadline to sharpen their minds.\nIt's possible, some analysts believe, that whoever takes power in London could be confronted with the same painful Brexit education May has undergone. That, they say, could lead to yet more uncertainty and requests for extensions.\nThere are some European leaders - notably French President Emmanuel Macron - who long to pull the ripcord and cast Britain away so they can move on with their own plans. \nBut for now, European diplomats expect that an extension in October would be granted, following the same logic as an emergency meeting of E.U. leaders last month. It probably would be worse for the E.U. to have Britain depart in an uncontrolled fashion than to extend the uncertainty, they say.\nGone by the wayside, for now, are European dreams of a second referendum in Britain that could reverse Brexit altogether. May's willingness to consider the idea helped spark the final rebellion that ousted her from office. Although most European leaders would be happy to put the brakes on Brexit if they had the chance to avoid it, they don't expect to do so.\nEuropean leaders have offered no additional concessions to Britain, despite May's struggle to pass the divorce deal, because they see the agreement less as a negotiation than as the only answer to a math problem.\nAdd up Britain's red lines and what results is the current divorce deal, as unpopular as it is, policymakers in Brussels say. The only way to change the deal is to take away some of the red lines, such as a desire not to have a customs barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain.\nThat won't change with May's successor.\nEven a no-deal Brexit wouldn't end the drama. The conversation the next day between London and Brussels would be the same. They still need to find a solution to keep open the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland to avoid sparking a new conflict. They have to agree on a way for British citizens to continue to live and work in the E.U., and vice versa. And the E.U. will still want Britain to live up to its financial commitments in the E.U. budget it agreed to before it decided to depart the bloc.\n\"Citizens, peace on the island of Ireland and money,\" one senior European diplomat warned last month, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. If there is a no-deal departure, the diplomat said, \"every term in the withdrawal agreement will still be discussed with the U.K.\" \ngriff.witte@washpost.com\nmichael.birnbaum@washpost.com"}, {"id": "187", "title": "May to resign, making way for a new leader on Brexit", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/theresa-may-to-resign-as-party-leader-make-way-for-new-british-prime-minister/2019/05/24/26e4cf56-7ca8-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:5:26 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON - Theresa May became the leader of Britain after the country voted in a June 2016 referendum to leave the European Union.

She told Britons that compromise was not a dirty word. \n\"I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high,\" she said. \"It is and will always remain a matter of deep regret for me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit.\"\nNear the end of her brief remarks, May noted that she was Britain's second female prime minister and promised there would be more women in the highest office. Then her voice became shaky and tears almost came as she said she was departing with \"no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.\" \nMay joins a series of Conservative prime ministers who have fallen over the question of Britain's relationship with Europe. David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, Britain's only other female prime minister, were all ousted in part because they could not get their party, let alone the country, to agree on how closely tied Britain and the continent should be.\nMay spent two years negotiating, in secret, a Brexit withdrawal deal with the E.U., only to see it rejected three times by the House of Commons, with many of her own Conservatives refusing to support her. Earlier this week, she was still vowing to push on and offered a tweaked version of her Brexit plan. It was rejected so swiftly and resoundingly by so many lawmakers, including members of her cabinet, that it became clear she would be ushered out soon.\nMay set out her departure plans shortly after a Friday morning meeting with Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative Party's powerful backbench \"1922 Committee.\" (Brady later in the day stepped down to consider a party leadership run.)\nMay will resign as party leader following a state visit by President Trump and D-Day commemorations. She will stay on as prime minister until the Conservatives, who will remain in power, select a new leader for their party and the country.\nIt seems likely they will choose someone who at least pays lip-service to the prospect of a no-deal Brexit - leaving the E.U. without a transition period and adopting a relationship governed by World Trade Organization rules. Economists have predicted that abrupt change would wreak havoc on both sides of the English Channel. \n\"It's quite extraordinary given that two to three years ago, the vast majority of Conservative MPs would have regarded a no-deal Brexit as impossible or highly irresponsible,\" said Rob Ford, a political scientist at the University of Manchester. \"Now, it's unlikely you'd be elected as the next prime minister without some level of commitment to that approach.\" \nThose eager to move to 10 Downing Street have been circling for some time. \nBoris Johnson, a flamboyant politician known around the country simply as \"Boris,\" once said, \"My chances of being PM are about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars.\" Yet he is the current favorite in opinion polls and betting markets to become the 77th British prime minister. \nOn Friday, Johnson complimented May on \"a very dignified statement.\" He tweeted his thanks to the outgoing prime minister for her \"stoical service\" and said it was \"now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit.\"\nNicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party, retweeted Johnson, adding the comment: \"What a hypocrite.\"\nJohnson is popular with the Conservative grass roots, who play a key role in choosing the party leader. He served two terms as mayor of London, which traditionally votes Labour, proving he also has some cross-party appeal. But he lost support in some circles after the 2016 referendum, when he put himself forward as the face of the Brexit campaign. And his record as foreign secretary under May was mixed.\nOthers who have declared interest in the top job include Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who confirmed his candidacy shortly after May's announcement Friday. Andrea Leadsom, who resigned as House of Commons leader this week and was a finalist alongside May in 2016, has said she is \"actively considering\" another leadership bid.\nA raft more are expected to follow. Among them: former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.\nUnder Conservative Party rules, any lawmaker can put their name forward, as long as they have the backing of two Conservative members of Parliament. Tory lawmakers then vote in a series of rounds, removing the person with the fewest votes, until only two are left. The 125,000 Conservative Party members then select their preferred candidate. \nKen Clarke, a senior Conservative lawmaker, said the leadership contest could be hard fought. \"We are going to have a chaotic six weeks now, as a diversion, possibly a harmful diversion from the deadlock on the European Union,\" Clarke told the BBC. He also noted that in Tory leadership races, the early favorite \"hasn't won one of these for a very long time.\"\nMarcus Roberts, international projects director at polling firm YouGov, said that if history is kind, May will be remembered as a leader who put in a good effort and even negotiated a decent Brexit deal with the E.U., but who wasn't able to play politics.\n\"She may have had the right intention, and she may have even got the best thing for Britain,\" he said. \"But it isn't enough if you don't know how to count in Parliament and you don't know how to sell in public.\"\nThere are those who say that, for any leader, getting a Brexit deal through Parliament would have been a nearly impossible task. And the dogged May stuck it out longer than many people predicted, remaining popular even with a public that hated her Brexit approach.\nBut some analysts argue that she got the sequencing of Brexit terribly wrong: She launched into negotiations with the E.U. before achieving consensus within her party. She told hard Brexiteers at the start of her premiership that she would honor their red lines, only to reverse her position later. She tried a cross-party approach near the very end of her time, not at the beginning.\n\"When you're at your max power as prime minister, that's when you can make magnificent generous offers,\" Roberts said. \"When you're clinging on by your fingernails, what are the incentives to make a deal with you and help you out?\" \nMay's support took a nose-dive in 2017, after she called an election she didn't have to and lost her party's parliamentary majority, setting up many struggles to come.\nLast month, she turned to opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to help break the Brexit impasse. Those talks collapsed last week. Corbyn said he could not negotiate with a leader on her way out.\nOn Friday, Corbyn tweeted: \"Theresa May is right to resign. She's now accepted what the country's known for months: she can't govern, and nor can her divided and disintegrating party.\"\nCorbyn called for an immediate general election after a new Tory leader is in place.\nIn Brussels, where E.U. policymakers have unhappily watched the British drama for years, May's departure was met with a shrug. \nMany there long ago gave up on her ability to deliver a deal and had been counting the days until her resignation. Nor do they expect much progress to be made on Brexit until the end of October, their new expiration date for Britain's E.U. membership.\nBut some fear that a new British prime minister will arrive with a fresh set of unrealistic expectations about what concessions the Europeans are willing to extend to London. Most E.U. leaders feel they have already gone as far as they will go. Britain would have to concede some of its own red lines before any major changes to the departure deal could be made, policymakers say.\n\"A new Prime Minister & the likely return of cakeism, unicorns and cherry-picking,\" Fabian Zuleeg, head of the European Policy Center think tank, wrote on Twitter, using three of Brussels' favorite terms for wishful thinking from London.\nkarla.adam@washpost.com\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nMichael Birnbaum in Brussels contributed to this report.\nMichaelGove\nBritain's environment, food and rural affairs secretary\nDominicRaab\nformer Brexit secretary\nJeremyHunt\nBritain's foreign secretary\nSajidJavid\nBritain's home secretary\nAngela Leadsom\nformer leader ofthe House of Commons\nBorisJohnson\nformer foreign secretary"}, {"id": "188", "title": "The prime minister's exit is unlikely to mend Britain's broken politics", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/will-teresa-mays-departure-fix-british-politics-dont-bet-on-it/2019/05/24/ed09eb50-7e4f-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:5:25 00:00:00", "content": "The resignation of British Prime Minister Theresa May might be seen as the key that unlocks the country from the debilitating debate over leaving the European Union. More likely is that her departure sets off a period that will bring even greater challenges and potentially more chaos to a weakened political system.\nMay tried for nearly three years to implement the Brexit referendum of June 2016 that, by a narrow margin, called for the country to sever ties with the E.U. Her mistakes were many, her political skills limited, her opponents implacable. Finally the members of her party, their patience run out, forced her to step aside. Her resignation resolves little, however, other than to make others try to do what she could not.\nWhat comes next? Oh, nothing much, other than a fractious fight to pick a new Conservative Party leader and prime minister, the Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the E.U. on terms still not known, and potentially a general election at some point that will test the coalitions of the Tories and the Labour Party.\nIt was perhaps fitting that May announced her resignation just as the elections for the European Parliament were taking place. The elections could bring significant setbacks to the major parties, but especially the Conservatives, due to the return of Nigel Farage under the banner of his new Brexit party. Those results Sunday could be an indicator of what lies ahead.\nThe existence of a rising pro-Brexit, anti-Europe party threatens to splinter the Conservatives even more than they have been. Whatever strength Farage's party shows in the European elections will be the first volley in the battle over the future direction of the Conservative Party at home. The coming leadership contest will be the first indicator of the party's future makeup and ideological balance.\nAt the starting gate, the betting favorite is Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who served for a time as foreign secretary in May's government. He is a charismatic but volatile politician who leaped aboard the Brexit express and became one of its most prominent faces during the referendum campaign in 2016.\nJohnson is as controversial as he is colorful. At an earlier point when May's future looked dim, he seemed like a long shot to compete for the leadership of the party. Today, he is seen as, perhaps, the person best positioned to protect the Tories from a significant erosion in support from the most ardent pro-Brexit voters.\nMay will step down as of June 7, but she will remain in place until her successor is selected. Johnson must run through the hurdles of the leadership contest, and he will have any number of rivals. Members of the Conservative Party must weigh the potential costs to its coalition of picking someone other than Johnson against the costs of putting their futures in the hands of someone so many of them do not fundamentally trust.\nJohnson is also fully capable of making a hash of his leadership bid. Rule nothing out when it comes to him.\nJohnson enjoys the apparent goodwill of President Trump. The president roiled British politics when he visited there last summer by saying in an interview with a British newspaper that he thought Johnson would make a fine prime minister. The interview landed just as May was hosting Trump at an elaborate ceremony and dinner and caused an uproar until the president lavished praise on his host the next day.\nBut the president, who embraced the Brexit vote when it happened, has also been friendly with Farage. He will be in Britain for a state visit just before May steps down and will be watched closely for any signs of partiality in the Tory leadership fight.\nHowever the leadership contest turns out, the next prime minister will be responsible for managing the country's exit from the E.U. May tried three times to get Parliament to support her plan, only to be defeated, in one case by the largest margin in the country's history.\nShe tried to work within her party - stubbornly, in the estimation of her critics - and when she hit the wall, she sought cross-party talks with Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Those talks predictably went nowhere, which is where things now stand.\nEuropean leaders have set Oct. 31 as a hard deadline - no more extensions, they have said. That could mean a \"hard Brexit,\" a departure without any real plan. The hard-liners in the Conservative Party have favored that course on the theory that Britain can and should write its own destiny. Others worry for good reason about the collateral damage to the nation's economy and the standing in the world of such a step.\nCan a new prime minister do better? A new pro-Brexit leader will be confronted by the same divisions that scuttled May's efforts. A pro-Brexit leader who goes soft in the hope of finding support across the party divisions risks a revolt and a party fracture. Britain could soon find that it was more than May's failures that brought her down. The political system as a whole has failed.\nMay succeeded David Cameron as prime minister when Cameron stepped down the day after losing the Brexit vote. He gambled and failed. May later gambled and failed by calling a snap election in 2017. She hoped the election would expand her parliamentary majority and strengthen her hand in the Brexit deliberations. Those elections resulted in a hung Parliament, eroding her power and ultimately sealing her fate, though it has taken nearly two years for that resolution to come about.\nThe selection of her successor could lead to another general election. Given the turmoil in the Conservative Party, a new election could be the vehicle for Labour to return to power for the first time in nearly a decade. But Labour, too, has its internal problems - and a leader in Corbyn who brings his own vulnerabilities.\nBritish politics is split at least four ways right now. There is the traditional competition between the two major parties, Conservative vs. Labour, although at this moment both are losing favor. Then there is also the fundamental, binary division in the country over Brexit - Leavers vs. Remainers. That has scrambled the coalitions of both parties and made leadership all the more difficult.\nCorbyn has tried to walk a tightrope. Widely seen as nominally pro-Brexit, or at least anti-E.U., personally, he has refused to declare a strong position on the biggest issue in British politics. He dances away from every effort by reporters to pin him down. In the European elections, he has done the same, claiming he wants his party to be a tent big enough to accommodate voters on both sides of the Brexit debate who otherwise side with Labour's politics and policies.\nIf the Conservatives remain as divided as they are now and if there is a pro-Brexit vehicle for voters to embrace, Labour would be in position to regain power, save for the fact that many voters probably would pause before putting the country in Corbyn's hands.\nBritish politics has been frozen for more than two years, to the dismay and disgust of British voters. May has been the focal point of much of this anger. The next months will tell whether the country is suffering from a more systemic breakdown or whether changes in leadership can restore trust and confidence that has taken a battering."}, {"id": "189", "title": "May to resign, making way for a new leader on Brexit", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/theresa-may-to-resign-as-party-leader-make-way-for-new-british-prime-minister/2019/05/24/26e4cf56-7ca8-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:5:26 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON - Theresa May became the leader of Britain after the country voted in a June 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. Brexit was her No. 1 job, and she failed to deliver it.\nMay announced Friday that she will resign as her party's leader June 7 and make way for a new British prime minister later this summer.\nSpeaking in front of the official residence, 10 Downing Street, May said she had \"done my best\" but was unable to sway members of Parliament to back her compromise vision of Brexit. She told Britons that compromise was not a dirty word. \n\"I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high,\" she said. \"It is and will always remain a matter of deep regret for me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit.\"\nNear the end of her brief remarks, May noted that she was Britain's second female prime minister and promised there would be more women in the highest office. Then her voice became shaky and tears almost came as she said she was departing with \"no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.\" \nMay joins a series of Conservative prime ministers who have fallen over the question of Britain's relationship with Europe. David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, Britain's only other female prime minister, were all ousted in part because they could not get their party, let alone the country, to agree on how closely tied Britain and the continent should be.\nMay spent two years negotiating, in secret, a Brexit withdrawal deal with the E.U., only to see it rejected three times by the House of Commons, with many of her own Conservatives refusing to support her. Earlier this week, she was still vowing to push on and offered a tweaked version of her Brexit plan. It was rejected so swiftly and resoundingly by so many lawmakers, including members of her cabinet, that it became clear she would be ushered out soon.\nMay set out her departure plans shortly after a Friday morning meeting with Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative Party's powerful backbench \"1922 Committee.\" (Brady later in the day stepped down to consider a party leadership run.)\nMay will resign as party leader following a state visit by President Trump and D-Day commemorations. She will stay on as prime minister until the Conservatives, who will remain in power, select a new leader for their party and the country.\nIt seems likely they will choose someone who at least pays lip-service to the prospect of a no-deal Brexit - leaving the E.U. without a transition period and adopting a relationship governed by World Trade Organization rules. Economists have predicted that abrupt change would wreak havoc on both sides of the English Channel. \n\"It's quite extraordinary given that two to three years ago, the vast majority of Conservative MPs would have regarded a no-deal Brexit as impossible or highly irresponsible,\" said Rob Ford, a political scientist at the University of Manchester. \"Now, it's unlikely you'd be elected as the next prime minister without some level of commitment to that approach.\" \nThose eager to move to 10 Downing Street have been circling for some time. \nBoris Johnson, a flamboyant politician known around the country simply as \"Boris,\" once said, \"My chances of being PM are about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars.\" Yet he is the current favorite in opinion polls and betting markets to become the 77th British prime minister. \nOn Friday, Johnson complimented May on \"a very dignified statement.\" He tweeted his thanks to the outgoing prime minister for her \"stoical service\" and said it was \"now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit.\"\nNicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party, retweeted Johnson, adding the comment: \"What a hypocrite.\"\nJohnson is popular with the Conservative grass roots, who play a key role in choosing the party leader. He served two terms as mayor of London, which traditionally votes Labour, proving he also has some cross-party appeal. But he lost support in some circles after the 2016 referendum, when he put himself forward as the face of the Brexit campaign. And his record as foreign secretary under May was mixed.\nOthers who have declared interest in the top job include Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who confirmed his candidacy shortly after May's announcement Friday. Andrea Leadsom, who resigned as House of Commons leader this week and was a finalist alongside May in 2016, has said she is \"actively considering\" another leadership bid.\nA raft more are expected to follow. Among them: former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.\nUnder Conservative Party rules, any lawmaker can put their name forward, as long as they have the backing of two Conservative members of Parliament. Tory lawmakers then vote in a series of rounds, removing the person with the fewest votes, until only two are left. The 125,000 Conservative Party members then select their preferred candidate. \nKen Clarke, a senior Conservative lawmaker, said the leadership contest could be hard fought. \"We are going to have a chaotic six weeks now, as a diversion, possibly a harmful diversion from the deadlock on the European Union,\" Clarke told the BBC. He also noted that in Tory leadership races, the early favorite \"hasn't won one of these for a very long time.\"\nMarcus Roberts, international projects director at polling firm YouGov, said that if history is kind, May will be remembered as a leader who put in a good effort and even negotiated a decent Brexit deal with the E.U., but who wasn't able to play politics.\n\"She may have had the right intention, and she may have even got the best thing for Britain,\" he said. \"But it isn't enough if you don't know how to count in Parliament and you don't know how to sell in public.\"\nThere are those who say that, for any leader, getting a Brexit deal through Parliament would have been a nearly impossible task. And the dogged May stuck it out longer than many people predicted, remaining popular even with a public that hated her Brexit approach.\nBut some analysts argue that she got the sequencing of Brexit terribly wrong: She launched into negotiations with the E.U. before achieving consensus within her party. She told hard Brexiteers at the start of her premiership that she would honor their red lines, only to reverse her position later. She tried a cross-party approach near the very end of her time, not at the beginning.\n\"When you're at your max power as prime minister, that's when you can make magnificent generous offers,\" Roberts said. \"When you're clinging on by your fingernails, what are the incentives to make a deal with you and help you out?\" \nMay's support took a nose-dive in 2017, after she called an election she didn't have to and lost her party's parliamentary majority, setting up many struggles to come.\nLast month, she turned to opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to help break the Brexit impasse. Those talks collapsed last week. Corbyn said he could not negotiate with a leader on her way out.\nOn Friday, Corbyn tweeted: \"Theresa May is right to resign. She's now accepted what the country's known for months: she can't govern, and nor can her divided and disintegrating party.\"\nCorbyn called for an immediate general election after a new Tory leader is in place.\nIn Brussels, where E.U. policymakers have unhappily watched the British drama for years, May's departure was met with a shrug. \nMany there long ago gave up on her ability to deliver a deal and had been counting the days until her resignation. Nor do they expect much progress to be made on Brexit until the end of October, their new expiration date for Britain's E.U. membership.\nBut some fear that a new British prime minister will arrive with a fresh set of unrealistic expectations about what concessions the Europeans are willing to extend to London. Most E.U. leaders feel they have already gone as far as they will go. Britain would have to concede some of its own red lines before any major changes to the departure deal could be made, policymakers say.\n\"A new Prime Minister & the likely return of cakeism, unicorns and cherry-picking,\" Fabian Zuleeg, head of the European Policy Center think tank, wrote on Twitter, using three of Brussels' favorite terms for wishful thinking from London.\nkarla.adam@washpost.com\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nMichael Birnbaum in Brussels contributed to this report.\nMichaelGove\nBritain's environment, food and rural affairs secretary\nDominicRaab\nformer Brexit secretary\nJeremyHunt\nBritain's foreign secretary\nSajidJavid\nBritain's home secretary\nAngela Leadsom\nformer leader ofthe House of Commons\nBorisJohnson\nformer foreign secretary"}, {"id": "190", "title": "No-deal Brexit looks likelier as May steps down", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/what-happens-next-with-brexit-now-that-theresa-may-is-resigning/2019/05/24/48bf3306-7e2d-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:5:26 00:00:00", "content": "Her replacement could see crashing out of E.U. as only means to deliver\nBERLIN - On one side of the English Channel, supporters see it as the greatest peace project the world has ever known.\nBut seen from that sceptered isle drifting scarcely 20 miles out at sea, the European Union looks more like a political assassin, one with a particularly rapacious appetite for British prime ministers.\nThe E.U. claimed its fourth victim in the past three decades on Friday, as a choked-up Theresa May announced that, having failed to get Britain out of the bloc, she would resign as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7 and make way for a new Conservative prime minister this summer. Three of her predecessors have also been evicted from Downing Street while trying to crack the code of Europe. \nNow, a growing list of Conservative politicians are jockeying to replace her. Each has promised to end the impasse that has left Britain stuck in the nether region between E.U. membership and life on the outside. But if May's successor is to avoid the same fate, analysts say, he or she may have little choice but to steer Britain toward what was once seen as a remote possibility but is increasingly viewed as a live prospect: a chaotic departure from the E.U. with no agreement on what comes next.\n\"A no-deal Brexit has become significantly more likely,\" said Steven Fielding, a politics professor at the University of Nottingham. \"Whoever follows May will be faced with an existential threat. They'll think, 'If I don't deliver Brexit, I'm finished.' \"\nIf Britain does jump into the post-E.U. world without a net, the impact would shake Britain's economy - with ripples, and perhaps waves, far beyond its shores. \nAnd yet several of May's would-be successors have already argued in favor of that option, reasoning that Britain's journey to freedom from the shackles of the E.U. begins with a departure on its own terms, rather than a compromise.\nBoris Johnson, the former foreign secretary and front-runner to succeed May, highlighted the possibility on Friday, telling an economics conference in Switzerland that his country would \"leave the E.U. on 31 October, deal or no deal.\" (Halloween is the next in a series of deadlines since Britain's vote to exit nearly three years ago.)\nOf course, that could be a bluff. Johnson acknowledged as much, adding that \"the way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no-deal.\"\nEuropean policymakers love to loathe the list of ardent Brexiteers now aiming to succeed May at 10 Downing Street. They reserve particular disdain for Johnson, whom they remember from his days whipping up hostility toward the E.U. as a Brussels-based correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. Johnson and his fellow Brexiteers have spent three years advocating negotiating positions that are unrealistic given European demands and pressures, Brussels diplomats say.\n\"There are some in London who think they can negotiate another deal,\" said Rosa Balfour, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. \"That's not going to happen. They've already got the best deal they're going to get. The red lines will not change.\"\nMay found that out the hard way. She repeatedly pressed her European counterparts to give her more beyond the compromise withdrawal deal she struck with them, so she could sell Parliament on the deal.\nBut she failed to get further meaningful concessions from Europe. And her fractious Parliament rejected the deal three times. May resigned rather than face the indignity of a fourth defeat.\nWith E.U. leaders insisting there will be no new negotiation, it is not clear how May's successor can follow through on Brexit other than by departing with no deal or fundamentally changing Britain's negotiating stance.\nMay's downfall follows that of David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, all of whom found themselves unable to unite the country - and, perhaps most critical, their party - behind a common position on Europe. \n\"The Conservative Party has been almost fatally divided on this issue since the 1980s,\" Fielding said. \"Successive party leaders have struggled to manage the divisions, and all of them have failed. The Conservative Party's problem has now become the British problem.\" \nConservatives will choose a new leader - and a new prime minister - over the next two months. Whoever wins the job will face the most daunting challenge yet in holding the party together. An expected drubbing in European Parliamentary elections at the hands of the Nigel Farage-led Brexit Party, which did not exist several months ago, will underline just how close the Conservatives are to cracking up, Fielding said. And it will probably embolden those on the right of the party who are pushing for an exit at any cost.\nA Prime Minister Johnson also might have very different priorities than the woman he would replace.\n\"May's overriding goal,\" Balfour said, \"was to save the Tory Party.\"\nJohnson, by contrast, may not care about bridging divides that have grown into a deep chasm. Like President Trump in the United States, he sees himself as an iconoclastic politician who can dominate by satisfying a base, rather than appeasing disparate factions.\nLittle will be clear before late October, Europeans expect, because they don't think British lawmakers will make any difficult decisions without a deadline to sharpen their minds.\nIt's possible, some analysts believe, that whoever takes power in London could be confronted with the same painful Brexit education May has undergone. That, they say, could lead to yet more uncertainty and requests for extensions.\nThere are some European leaders - notably French President Emmanuel Macron - who long to pull the ripcord and cast Britain away so they can move on with their own plans. \nBut for now, European diplomats expect that an extension in October would be granted, following the same logic as an emergency meeting of E.U. leaders last month. It probably would be worse for the E.U. to have Britain depart in an uncontrolled fashion than to extend the uncertainty, they say.\nGone by the wayside, for now, are European dreams of a second referendum in Britain that could reverse Brexit altogether. May's willingness to consider the idea helped spark the final rebellion that ousted her from office. Although most European leaders would be happy to put the brakes on Brexit if they had the chance to avoid it, they don't expect to do so.\nEuropean leaders have offered no additional concessions to Britain, despite May's struggle to pass the divorce deal, because they see the agreement less as a negotiation than as the only answer to a math problem.\nAdd up Britain's red lines and what results is the current divorce deal, as unpopular as it is, policymakers in Brussels say. The only way to change the deal is to take away some of the red lines, such as a desire not to have a customs barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain.\nThat won't change with May's successor.\nEven a no-deal Brexit wouldn't end the drama. The conversation the next day between London and Brussels would be the same. They still need to find a solution to keep open the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland to avoid sparking a new conflict. They have to agree on a way for British citizens to continue to live and work in the E.U., and vice versa. And the E.U. will still want Britain to live up to its financial commitments in the E.U. budget it agreed to before it decided to depart the bloc.\n\"Citizens, peace on the island of Ireland and money,\" one senior European diplomat warned last month, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. If there is a no-deal departure, the diplomat said, \"every term in the withdrawal agreement will still be discussed with the U.K.\" \ngriff.witte@washpost.com\nmichael.birnbaum@washpost.com"}], "2": [{"id": "94", "title": "London Mayor Boris Johnson backs \u2018Brexit,\u2019 boosting anti-E.U. campaign", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/londons-mayor-a-big-beast-of-british-politics-ready-to-make-a-call-on-brexit/2016/02/21/17108581-db19-458d-8834-ef4a639d8165_story.html?utm_term=.f3bc5a5f04c4", "time_stamp": "2016:2:22 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON \u2014\u00a0Mayor Boris Johnson, one of the most charismatic figures in U.K. politics, threw his considerable influence behind the push for a British exit from the European Union on Sunday, instantly galvanizing the campaign and potentially tipping the country toward a vote to leave in a June referendum.\nThe decision to defy Prime Minister David Cameron, a fellow Conservative, represents a personal gamble for the ever-irreverent politician and a major coup for the \u201cleave\u201d camp, which has been riven by bickering factions and has lacked a high-profile, broadly palatable advocate.\nAlthough Johnson had long been coy about his intentions, the conventional political wisdom in Britain only days ago was that the mayor would take the safe bet and support staying in. But Johnson exploded that belief on Sunday afternoon when he walked out the front door of his gray-brick rowhouse in north London and casually announced to waiting reporters that he would call for Brits to cut ties with the E.U.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything else I can do,\u201d he said, speaking, as is custom, without notes and in tones that alternated between soaring oratory and shambolic muttering. \u201cI will be advocating Vote Leave \u2014 or whatever the team is called; I understand there are many of them \u2014 because I want a better deal for the people of this country, to save them money and take back control.\u201d\nThe mop-haired mayor\u2019s announcement adds a new layer of meaning to a referendum already laden with consequence. When Britons vote June 23, the ballot will ask simply whether the country should stay in the E.U. or go.\nBut also at stake will be the future of the 28-member bloc, the viability of the United Kingdom itself and Britain\u2019s standing as Washington\u2019s closest and most important ally.\nNow, the keys to 10 Downing Street could be on the line, as well.\n[European leaders strike deal to try to keep Britain in the E.U.]\nThe 51-year-old Johnson, who was born in New York but said last year he was giving up his U.S. passport to avoid taxes, denied Sunday that his E.U. call had anything to do with his at times\u00a0barely concealed ambitions\u00a0to secure the top job in British politics. In answers to reporters\u2019 questions, he insisted that Cameron \u201chas got to stay\u201d as prime minister even if the country chooses \u201cBrexit.\u201d\nBut if Johnson ends up leading the country out of Europe, persuading a majority of British voters to ignore the prime minister\u2019s\u00a0passionate call\u00a0for the country to stay in, there will almost certainly be intense pressure on Cameron to resign. And Johnson, having seized the populist moment, would be uniquely positioned to take his place.\nCameron once named Johnson as one of three possible successors after the prime minister steps down, as planned, before the end of his second term in 2020; the other two have both backed the \u201cin\u201d campaign. After Johnson\u2019s announcement Sunday, critics assailed him for political opportunism, but bookmakers also made him the favorite to become the next prime minister.\nJohnson was the last major British politician to reveal his stance on the E.U. vote, with all of the others declaring their intentions long ago or on Saturday \u2014 when Cameron officially announced the referendum date. In keeping with Johnson\u2019s reputation for high-profile stunts and ego-enhancing maneuvers, he kept both sides guessing throughout Sunday \u2014 and forced both to plea for his backing.\nCameron took to the BBC on Sunday morning to ask that Johnson carefully consider the impact of his choice.\n\u201cI would say to Boris what I say to everybody else, which is that we will be safer, we will be stronger, we will be better off inside the E.U.\u201d Cameron told host Andrew Marr.\nBut perhaps anticipating that the mayor had already locked in his decision to side with the \u201cleave\u201d camp, Cameron also took some digs at Johnson, musing about whether the mayor wanted to be \u201clinking arms\u201d with Nigel Farage and George Galloway \u2014 prominent E.U. critics who inhabit, respectively, the far-right and far-left extremes of British politics.\nUntil Johnson\u2019s announcement, only relatively marginal political figures had supported a Brexit. The choice to cut ties with Europe is more popular at the grass-roots of British politics than it is among elected officials. Recent opinion polls show that the \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d camps are effectively tied.\nThat\u2019s a striking shift from the landscape only months ago, when a clear majority of Brits seemed to favor staying in the union that has defined the postwar political and economic order on the continent.\nBut Europe\u2019s struggles with the refugee crisis, its persistent economic malaise and its long-standing pattern of dysfunction have all contributed to rising dissatisfaction among Brits \u2014 and a growing desire to sever a decades-long relationship.\nThe consequences of such a choice would be felt globally. Britain has long been an ambivalent member of the E.U., deeply skeptical of political integration and refusing to go along with major initiatives such as the common currency and the passport-free Schengen zone.\nBut it is also one of the union\u2019s cornerstone members, with a seat at the U.N. Security Council, a nuclear arsenal and the world\u2019s fifth largest economy. The country\u2019s departure could cause the E.U. to crumble at a time when it is already inundated with crises and facing rising Euroskepticism continent-wide.\nBritain\u2019s E.U. partners have all pleaded for the country to stay, as has the United States. President Obama has said that the E.U. and Britain are better off with the country inside the bloc. U.S. officials have suggested that British influence would be vastly diminished if the country chooses to get out, threatening the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two nations.\nThe United Kingdom itself could be vulnerable to a breakup if the country votes to leave the union: Scotland is considerably more pro-E.U. than England, and Scottish leaders have said they will revive a call for independence should Britain opt to leave. A referendum on independence two years ago went down to a relatively narrow defeat.\nCameron has staked his legacy to settling both of Britain\u2019s great existential questions \u2014 one country or two, part of Europe or not. In both cases, he has favored the status quo.\nBut now Johnson, whom critics regard as a craven opportunist, could disrupt those plans.\n[London Mayor Boris Johnson clobbers young boy while playing touch rugby]\nA recent poll by Ipsos Mori sheds light on why his endorsement of the \u201cout\u201d camp matters: A third of British voters said they would take Johnson\u2019s views into account when making up their minds on the E.U. (And 44 percent said the same about Cameron.)\nA gifted communicator, Johnson has cultivated a bumbling, gaffe-prone public persona that has somehow worked to his advantage, making him relatable to voters outside the London political bubble and diverting attention from his thoroughly upper-crust English background.\nLess charming politicians might find themselves in trouble if they\u00a0got stuck dangling from a zip-line\u00a0during the Olympics or had\u00a0flattened a 10-year-old boy\u00a0during a rugby match in Japan. But Johnson has a unique way of disentangling himself from mishaps both large and small.\nHis eight-year tenure as mayor of London has received mixed reviews \u2014 he has often seemed disengaged and distracted by his roles as a Winston Churchill biographer, newspaper columnist and television personality \u2014 but he is a colorful character who stands out from other identikit politicians.\nStill, hitching his wagon to the \u201cleave\u201d camp represents a big risk. If Britain votes to stay in the E.U., Cameron could revoke his offer of a top cabinet job when Johnson steps down as mayor in May.\nJohnson is not the only defector. On Saturday,\u00a0six of Cameron\u2019s senior ministers\u00a0came out in favor of Brexit, including his close friend, Justice Secretary Michael Gove.\nBut unlike Gove, a Euroskeptic of long-standing, Johnson has a complicated history of views on Europe that have at times seemed to sway with the political winds.\nTim Farron, leader of the pro-E.U. Liberal Democrats, took aim at that inconsistency on Sunday, saying, \u201cBoris has had more positions on Europe than the Kama Sutra.\u201d\nJohnson himself insisted that his desire to see Britain leave the E.U. was deeply rooted and sincere.\nThe stance, Johnson said, may lead some to depict him as \u201ca crazy crank.

The referendum expected this June on whether the country should stay in the European Union will define his legacy.\nThis month, Mr. Cameron announced a draft deal on his renegotiation over the terms of Britain's membership in the European Union. While there were still plenty of details to iron out, the proposed agreement seemed to satisfy most of the prime minister's demands. Last week, Mr. Cameron went back to Brussels  in hopes of finalizing the deal. \n  Among the major points in the draft deal were assurances that non-eurozone countries would not be discriminated against; cutting back on clumsy European Union regulations; and an exemption from the European Union's stated goal of ''ever closer union'' with, instead, a strengthening of the role of national parliaments. On these points, the package looked promising for Britain.\n  But the fate of a fourth demand -- restricting welfare benefits for European Union migrants -- remained precarious. The draft deal called for an ''emergency brake'' that Britain could apply to restrict welfare benefits to European migrants, but even as proposed, the brake would be relaxed over time, with more benefits paid to migrants the longer they stayed in Britain. Poland and Hungary in particular saw the measure as discriminating against their citizens.\n  Mr. Cameron's first hurdle last week was to secure the support of other European leaders for the reform package. In this, he succeeded -- though, under the deal, the emergency brake will end after seven years, which seems unlikely to mollify Mr. Cameron's euroskeptic critics.\n  But even as Mr. Cameron toiled to win the backing of Britain's European partners, he faced the bigger test of selling the package to his Conservative Party and his own ministers, as well as a hostile press and a skeptical public.\n  British leaders, including the current prime minister, have usually played down the benefits of European Union membership. This has tended to enable the so-called euroskeptics to hijack the debate.\n  A 2012 government report gave a largely positive assessment of the relationship between Britain and the union, yet you will rarely hear a minister trumpet the merits of membership. British politicians have been far too reticent about the benefits of belonging to the world's largest single market. Rather than emphasizing how Europe has become a source of foreign investment vital to the British economy, they've preferred to rant about migrants and stifling ''red tape'' from Brussels.\n  Migrants from the European Union have often been used as scapegoats when the real culprit for weak economic performance has been government mismanagement. European migrants, in fact, are more likely than native-born Britons to be working and paying taxes, contributing more to the Treasury than they receive.\n  At the same time, the Cameron government has hardly trumpeted the British role in the European Union's leadership on climate change. Without Britain's efforts, alongside those of its union partners, France would probably have struggled to reach the new global agreement on climate change that was sealed in Paris in December.\n  Political leaders have rarely spoken of the value and importance of working with Britain's European neighbors on sharing intelligence about terrorists or confronting organized crime. Tellingly, the United States wants Britain to stay in the union; Russia, on the other hand, would be delighted if it left.\n  The Cameron government has avoided explaining what leaving the European Union would mean: Economists point to stark possible consequences, including a serious dent to growth or, at worse, a recession. Renegotiating scores of trade agreements would be a huge and prolonged effort. Nor has the government made any provision for the roughly two million Britons living in other European Union countries, including tens of thousands who are unemployed and often claim more in benefits from those countries than migrants in Britain do.\n  The result is that myths and disinformation have flourished. Opinion polls in Britain consistently show high levels of ambivalence, ignorance and suspicion about the European Union. Soon after the draft deal was announced, a YouGov survey showed an increase in support of a British exit, or Brexit, with 45 percent of respondents in favor of leaving the union and 36 percent against -- although other recent polls have shown a majority in favor of staying in.\n  If a majority in England votes to leave the Europe Union, while a majority of Scots votes to remain, this could lead to another referendum on whether Scotland should remain in the United Kingdom. Nationalists would push for an independent Scotland to rejoin the European Union. Mr. Cameron's legacy could then include the breakup of Britain.\n  Unchecked by its leadership, Conservative Party infighting over Europe has intensified. Some members of Parliament have already announced that they will vote to leave the union no matter what renegotiation their prime minister achieves -- an Ipsos Mori survey found that a fifth of Tory parliamentarians who responded would vote for Brexit regardless of the new deal. According to The Daily Telegraph and the BBC, six cabinet ministers would vote to leave, with six others yet to decide pending the result of the renegotiation.\n  Mr. Cameron already pledged to step down as party leader before the next general election, in 2020. Because of this, some contenders may view the referendum as a wedge issue in the future leadership contest. One likely candidate, Boris Johnson, London's mayor, has already announced that he will campaign against Mr. Cameron's deal.\n  This framing of the debate in party terms distracts from a serious conversation about Britain's relationship with Europe. Britain faces this referendum not in response to any crisis within Europe, but because Mr. Cameron decided he had to appease the euroskeptics in his own party.\n  Managing the Conservative Party's neurosis about Europe will now take bold leadership. Only if Mr. Cameron is clear about the consequences of Brexit -- and the benefits of staying in -- can he win the argument and secure a favorable legacy."}], "13": [{"id": "95", "title": "The Latest: Trump says Britain has taken back independence", "publisher": "Fox News", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-latest-trump-says-britain-has-taken-back-independence", "time_stamp": "2016:6:25 00:00:00", "content": "AYRSHIRE, Scotland \u2013\u00a0The Latest on Donald Trump's visit to Scotland to see his remodeled golf resort (all times local):\n12:25 p.m.\nDonald Trump says the British people have \"taken back their independence\" with a vote to leave the European Union.\nTrump is talking to reporters in Scotland, where he is visiting two of his golf courses.\nHe is drawing parallels between the so-called Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential campaign, saying people want to take their borders back.\nThe British vote was marked by debate on some of the populist themes driving the Trump campaign, such as concerns about immigration and border security.\nTrump also says David Cameron, who plans to resign as British prime minister because of the vote, \"is a good man,\" but was wrong on the Brexit issue.\n____\n11:45 a.m.\nDonald Trump says in a Facebook post that the decision of the British people to get out of the European Union was a vote \"to reassert control over their own politics, border and economy.\"\nThe item was posted as Trump was getting set to visit his Turnberry golf resort after arriving Friday in Scotland.\nHe says in the post that in November \"the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence.\"\nHe adds that \"a Trump administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense.\"\nTrump said \"the whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries \u2014 and our two peoples \u2014 are united together, as they will be under a Trump administration.\"\n___\n11:15 a.m.\nDonald Trump's brief visit to Scotland comes the day after the British voted to leave the European Union, and while he cheered the outcome, his agenda this trip isn't politics.\nInstead, Trump is visiting a pair of his golf courses.

And you see it in Europe, all over Europe.\"\nAnd while Scotland itself voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union, Trump is right. Right-wing nationalist movements, fueled by anger toward political elites and mistrust of immigration \u2014 and primarily backed by white voters \u2014 are gaining more and more momentum on the continent.\n\"This is not a unique phenomenon to the United States, and 2016 is not a short moment that will pass,\" says Yascha Mounk, who teaches political theory at Harvard University and has studied the rise of nationalist movements. \"This is a real populist turn that has been happening for the last 15 or 20 years.\"\nIn recent decades, nationalist movements have shifted from vocal minorities to powerful parties that gained control of governments in places like Hungary, have lost national elections by the slimmest of margins in countries like Austria, and, this week, forced the United Kingdom out of the European Union.\nMounk pegs economic stagnation among lower- and middle-class whites as a main driver for nationalism's rise around the globe. \"You have a socially descending middle class that hasn't had real gains in the standard of living in 30 years,\" he said. \"And at the same time, you seem to have real improvements in social status, if not necessarily economic status, for ethnic minorities. So they feel like our country is being taken away.\"\nAdd to that mix an immigration and refugee crisis tied to Syria's civil war, which has flooded European countries, especially, with scores of migrants looking for jobs, social-services protections and housing.\nWhile each movement has its own unique characteristics, there are many similarities that are fueling nationalism in the United States, the U.K. and other European nations.\nA contempt for the elite ruling classes\n\"People feel, quite rightly, that they have no real control over political systems \u2014 that the political class does what it wants and it sort of ignores ordinary people,\" Mounk says. \"And to a large extent, that's because of the necessities of globalization.\"\nThe contempt was clear in the victory speech of Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party and a leading voice in the long push for the U.K. to disassociate from the EU.\n\"This will be a victory for the real people, a victory for the ordinary people,\" he said early Friday morning when it was clear the Leave campaign had won the referendum. \"We have fought against the multinationals. We fought against the big merchant banks. We fought against big politics.\"\nTrump has sounded similar calls throughout his campaign.\n\"We'll never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place,\" Trump said\u00a0earlier this week, adding, \"It's rigged by big donors, who want to keep wages down. It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country.\"\nWhile the feeling has largely gone mainstream in recent years \u2014 both of those quotes could have been said by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 anti-elite sentiments have been a key part of nationalist parties' persona for decades.\nBlaming immigrants\nAfter the ISIS-inspired mass shooting in San Bernardino last December, Trump amped up warnings about Syrian refugees immigrating to the United States. He called for an across-the-board halt of all Muslims entering the country, warning they carried the risk of additional terror attacks.\nWhile many Republicans hoped Trump would back away from his proposed ban on an entire religion, he embraced it even tighter after the Orlando shootings.\n\"We need to tell the truth, also, about how radical Islam is coming to our shores,\" Trump said in the wake of the attack. \"And it's coming. With these people, folks, it's coming.\"\nTrump even blamed \"Muslim communities,\" en masse, for failing to tip off authorities about both the Orlando and San Bernardino attacks.\n\"The idea of nativism \u2014 of seeing your country under threat by non-natives, specifically immigrants and Muslims, is something that Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump clearly share,\" says Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia professor, who specializes in nationalist movements.\nLe Pen heads the National Front party in France. In the wake of last year's Paris terror attacks,\u00a0she told NPR\u00a0that France needed \"to institute a major policy, which would reestablish our own borders. This means we need to stop accepting this influx of immigrants.\"\nShe called the continued flow of Syrian refugees into Europe \"madness\" and urged for an end to the open-border policy that is a hallmark of the European Union.\n\"I think when people are disappointed and hurt and angry, they revert to a very basic part of human psychology,\" Mounk says. \"And that is in-group versus out-group. Us versus them. And it's always easy to blame immigrants.\"\nIt can be popular, too. Exit polls conducted throughout the Republican primaries this year consistently showed a solid majority of GOP voters supporting Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration.\nSimple solutions\nMounk says the basic approach of many populist, nationalist candidates can be boiled down to this: \"I embody the will of the people. And the problems that we face are actually completely straightforward,\" he said. \"The problem is that the elites are corrupt. They're in cahoots with minorities, with business interests. And all that needs to happen is for me to be elected.\"\nIt's a sentiment that can be heard in Trump's most recent major campaign speech. \"When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries for that matter,\" he said, \"I know these problems can all be fixed. But not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me.\"\nThe best example of a simple solution to a complex problem: Trump's vow to curtail immigrants from entering the country illegally by building a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 and forcing Mexico to foot the bill.\nHungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, is perhaps the most high-profile nationalist politician to head a nation. He went ahead and built a wall of his own last year in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants from Syria.\n\"Many people criticize the physical barrier we are just setting up at this moment in Hungary,\" he said at the European Union headquarters in Brussels last year. \"I ask everybody \u2014 all the European leaders \u2014 what else ideas they have.\"\nIs nationalism here to stay?\nIt's clear that the factors galvanizing nationalist sentiments aren't going anywhere any time soon. Western democracies continue to become increasingly multicultural. Globalization will remain \u2014 despite attempts to stop it, like the U.K.'s Brexit vote.\nAnd the most powerful factor \u2014 economic stagnation \u2014 appears more likely to remain, too. The Brexit vote triggered market turmoil around the globe Friday, raising questions about long-term economic affect of the move.\nSo nationalism will continue to be a powerful political tool, and it's clear Trump will embrace the theme through the November election, seeing Brexit as fuel.\n\"I really do see a parallel between what's happening in the United States and what's happening here,\" he said in Scotland Friday. \"People want to see borders. They don't necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don't know who they are and where they came from. They have no idea.\"\nHow much is nationalism at the core of Trump's political ethos? At the end of his speech Wednesday, Trump veered off script into an almost stream-of-consciousness mantra.\n\"Americans, Americans,\" he said. \"The people that we love.\"\n\"Americans,\" he continued. \"America first. Make our country great again.\n\"Americans.\""}, {"id": "192", "title": "Trump on Brexit: America is next", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://us.cnn.com/2016/06/24/politics/us-election-brexit-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html", "time_stamp": "2016:6:25 00:00:00", "content": "Washington (CNN)British voters just shattered political convention in a stunning repudiation of the ruling establishment. Donald Trump is betting America is about to do the same.\nVoters in the UK did more than reject the European Union and topple their pro-EU Prime Minister David Cameron in a referendum Thursday.\nThey also set off a cascade of events that could spark global economic chaos, remake the Western world, reverberate through November's presidential election and challenge U.S. security for years to come.\nThe referendum campaign -- just like the U.S. election -- has boiled with populist anger, fear-mongering by politicians, hostility towards distant political elites and resurgent nationalism, and exposed a visceral feeling in the electorate that ordinary voters have lost control of the politics that shape their own lives. Its success raises the question of whether those forces will exert a similar influence in America in November.\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who arrived in the UK to visit his Scottish golf courses just as the referendum result was announced, declared Friday that the U.S. is next.\n\"Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence. Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first,\" he said. \"They will have the chance to reject today's rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people.\"\nIndeed, British voters delivered the kind of crushing rejection of the political, business and media elites that Trump has been railing against.\nThe Brits also snubbed President Barack Obama's warnings against voting to leave Europe and risked triggering a global recession that would weaken already sluggish U.S. economic growth and dampen the hopes of his chosen successor, Hillary Clinton.\nIn her first reaction to the news from Britain, Clinton immediately took a swipe at Trump, though not by name. She called for Americans to respond to the vote by pulling together \"to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down.\"\nClinton also noted the global economic risks of the UK referendum, saying in a statement: \"Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.\"\nIn a particularly striking development, UK voters completely disregarded warnings from elite voices of the consequences of tearing the political system that has largely delivered peace and prosperity since World War II.\nSimilar warnings have been heard in the U.S. election -- especially from Clinton and establishment politicians who fear Trump's \"America First\" stance would send shockwaves through the global system and see America pull back from its role as a guarantor of Western security.\nBut in the UK this week, outsider politicians seem to have carried just as much weight with many British voters as more conventional fact-based arguments. World authorities like the IMF for example warned about the consequences of a Brexit -- but voters went ahead and voted to leave anyway.\nSpeaking to CNN, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the Brexit result as a \"big experiment in insurgent politics.\"\nHe said the centre-left and centre-right needed to \"rediscover radical, powerful answers in a climate driven by anger ... a revolt against what is seen as established wisdom, but what is actually people making difficult decisions in difficult circumstances.\"\nThere are, of course, several key differences between the British referendum and America's looming election.\nThe UK vote was mostly about delivering a stunning and final blow to the country's long and reluctant marriage with Europe and turned on a host of local factors including extreme Euro-skepticism within the governing Conservative Party, distrust of European politicians and institutions and disenchantment with Britain's reduced place in the world.\nBut in a larger symbolic sense, the referendum result, narrow as it was -- 52% to 48% -- demonstrated the potential of voters to wield a stunning shock to the political system that can shatter the logic and assumptions of conventional politics.\nThere's no guarantee that American voters will show the same kind of rebelliousness and willingness to leap into the unknown in November as a slim majority of Britons did on Thursday. And the U.S. system of state-by-state races and an electoral college could mitigate against some of the grassroots anger that exploded in a binary \"Leave\" or \"Remain\" vote in Britain.\nBut events in Europe must trigger at least some concern among Democrats.\nPollsters in the UK underestimated the fury of grassroots voters outside metropolitan areas in a way that could be mirrored in the United States, where Clinton now enjoys a lead in national surveys.\nFurthermore, \"Brexit\" forces triumphed partly because the Labour Party could not deliver its traditional working class voters in some big post-industrial cities for the \"Remain\" campaign, despite the support of party leaders.\nIt is not a stretch to wonder whether the kind of political message that was so powerful in the referendum -- featuring a harsh critique of free trade and a demands to \"take our country back\" -- could prove just as effective among blue-collar workers in rust belt states in the United States.\nCertainly, it's a message that Trump has been hammering with success all election season and is at the center of his claims to be able to remake the U.S. electoral map. And the billionaire has consistently bested Clinton when voters are asked who is best equipped to handle the economy.\nThe immediate stock market contagion unleashed by the referendum across the globe represented the worst equity carnage since the start of the Great Recession in 2008.\nIf the losses prove short-lived, the impact of the referendum on the U.S. economy and politics could be temporary.\nBut if \"Brexit\" ushers in a period of economic volatility across Europe that begins to squelch growth, the U.S. economy could be badly affected -- complicating Clinton's bid to pull off the tough assignment of winning a third consecutive White House term for the Democrats.\nTrump would meanwhile seize on any slowdown in the U.S. precipitated by Brexit to argue that Obama's economic management is a failure and it is time to try something new.\nBut there are also warning signs for Trump.\nThough he was quick to claim a share of the credit for the British political earthquake -- placing it in the context of a revolt against global elites in which he sees himself as a major player -- a prolonged period of world turmoil could also work against the billionaire former reality star.\nSuch an environment could bolster Clinton's claims that a crisis is no time to choose a president who has no experience of governing and that her pedigree as a former secretary of state and relationships with leaders all over the world are a perfect fit for a perilous moment.\nThe Democratic presumptive nominee made that argument in her statement: \"This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.\"\nHer campaign later issued a fundraising appeal with that message, writing, \"No matter what the collective wisdom of our political punditry has to say between now and November, Donald Trump has a real chance of winning this election.\"\nClinton's campaign worked hard to demonstrate a contrast between Clinton and Trump as potential leaders in a time of crisis. The Clinton camp also sought to downplay similarities between the seething political scenes in the U.K. and the United States.\n\"It is important that we recognize that this American election is about what is happening here in America not what is happening in Yorkshire or in Cardiff,\" said Clinton's senior adviser Jake Sullivan on a conference call.\nSullivan also rejected the idea that Clinton could find herself overtaken by a similar populist tide in November, saying she had spent months on the campaign trail and was intimately familiar with the difficulties facing many working Americans.\nThe possible economic consequences of Brexit in the short-term could be dwarfed by the geopolitical shakeup that is now looming in the years to come.\nBritain's referendum has already set off calls in Europe for similar separation votes in other Eurosceptic nations, threatening to dismantle the economic and political union that has been a pillar of transatlantic stability for 70 years and been a crucial partner for the United States.\nAs the U.S. faces challenges to its power in Asia from a rising China and in Europe from a recalcitrant Russia and in the Middle East from a motley group of insurgent forces, Washington can hardly afford the splintering of its co-guarantor of Western security.\nIn addition, the referendum looks likely to result in the fracturing of America's closest historic ally, the United Kingdom -- a factor that could be a diplomatic nightmare for the next president.\nIn the hours after the vote,\u00a0Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans to draft new legislation\u00a0to allow a second independence referendum north of the border after pro-EU Scots narrowly voted to stay in the United Kingdom in 2014.\nThough a Scottish referendum may not take place for years, it will revive questions about a neutering of British military power and the fate of Britain's Scotland-based nuclear deterrent -- which nationalists opposed and is part of NATO's security infrastructure -- that the next U.S. president will be forced to grapple with."}], "59": [{"id": "104", "title": "UK's May concedes Brexit deal won't pass 'in near future'", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.apnews.com/22ea0b32e0594115982724a0944302e6", "time_stamp": "2019:4:7 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - British Prime Minister Theresa May acknowledged that the government's strategies to get her Brexit deal approved in Parliament failed, saying Saturday there's little prospect lawmakers will back the thrice-rejected divorce agreement \"in the near future.\"\nWith the U.K. once again days away from a deadline for leaving the European Union, May pressured opposition lawmakers to help her find a compromise agreement instead, saying voters \"expect their politicians to work together when the national interest demands it.\"\nAfter May's deal with the EU out for a third time in the House of Commons, the prime minister invited the opposition Labour Party this week to discuss alternatives.

The party says Britain should remain closely bound to EU trade rules and maintain the bloc's standards in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protection.\nBritain is due to leave the EU on Friday unless May can secure another delay from the EU, which already agreed to postpone the Brexit day originally set for March 29.\nMay now is asking for Britain's departure to be pushed back until June 30, hoping to reach a compromise with Labour and a deal through Parliament in a matter of weeks.\n\"The longer this takes, the greater the risk of the U.K. never leaving at all,\" May said in a statement.\nBut EU leaders favor a longer delay to avoid another round of cliff-edge preparations and politics. And they say the U.K. needs to put forward a concrete plan to end the stalemate to get any further postponement.\nAn extension requires unanimous approval from the 27 remaining leaders, some of whom are fed up with Brexit uncertainty and reluctant to prolong it further.\nLast month, the EU gave Britain until April 12 to approve the withdrawal agreement it reached with the May's government, to change course and seek a further delay to Brexit, or to crash out of the EU with no deal in place or transition period to cushion the shock.\nThe leaders of EU member countries are due to meet in Brussels Wednesday - two days before the April 12 deadline - to consider Britain's request for a second extension.\nEconomists and business leaders have warned a no-deal Brexit would severely disrupt trade and travel, with tariffs and customs checks causing gridlocked British ports and possible shortages of some foods, medicines and other products.\nWorries about a chaotic British exit are especially acute in Ireland, the only EU member that shares a land border with the U.K. Any customs checks or other obstacles along the currently invisible frontier would hammer the Irish economy and could undermine Northern Ireland's peace process.\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Saturday that it was \"extremely unlikely\" any of the 27 countries would veto a delay.\n\"If one country was to veto an extension and, as a result, impose hardship on us, real problems for the Dutch and Belgians and French as neighboring countries (to the U.K.)...they wouldn't be forgiven for it,\" he told Ireland's RTE radio.\n___"}, {"id": "107", "title": "UK's prime minister asks EU to delay Brexit until June 30", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.apnews.com/cd16164c9bf743ec8376227417b15628", "time_stamp": "2019:4:5 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday again sought to delay Brexit until June 30 to avoid a chaotic withdrawal from the European Union in one week, although a key leader of the bloc suggested an even longer pause in the difficult divorce proceedings.\nThe question over timing is vital because Britain is set to leave the EU without a withdrawal deal in place on April 12 unless an agreement is reached at a Brussels summit set to take place two days earlier.\nIn a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, May asked for an extension until the end of June and agreed to make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections on May 23-26 if necessary.\nAn earlier British request for a delay until June 30 was rejected last month, amid rising irritation from EU leaders about the political chaos in London. There also having been increasing fears that the longer the U.K. stays, the more it will obstruct EU policies and plans.\nTusk proposed a longer time frame Friday and he urged the 27 remaining EU nations to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn't leave the bloc in a chaotic way that could undermine commerce and hurt many EU nations.\nTwo EU officials said Tusk wants a one-year period, which has been dubbed a \"flextension,\" and hopes to get it approved at the EU summit on April 10. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose information before it was made public.\nSuch a move would mean that the U.K. would need to take part in the elections to the European Parliament, something May has long argued would not be in either side's interest.\nThe elections pose a substantial stumbling block because Britain would be expected to take part, if it is still an EU member, so its people have representation in the European Parliament. Officials worry that the legitimacy of European institutions could be jeopardized if the population of a member state is not involved in the process.\nEU nations already have watched nearly three years of political anxiety over Brexit.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has thus far seemed cagey about giving Britain more time, saying the bloc cannot be held hostage by Britain's political deadlock over Brexit.\nThere are also concerns in Europe that some British politicians who want to provoke a \"no-deal\" Brexit might try to make trouble from inside the bloc, a course that outspoken Brexit advocate Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested Friday.\nHe tweeted that \"if a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU, we should be as difficult as possible.\"\nThe Conservative Party lawmaker suggested using Britain's positon to veto any EU budget increases, block the establishment of an EU army, and make it impossible for Macron to push further EU integration.\nOne EU diplomat said that there was rising concern among member states that they would not get \"sincere cooperation\" from Britain, which could hurt how the bloc functions.\n\"There are important decisions to be taken after EU elections,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to comment on closed-door meetings preparing for next week's summit.\nThere also were fears about a chaotic Brexit on April 12.\nThere are concerns that such an abrupt exit without a deal could lead to economic slowdown and a breakdown in food and medical supplies as border checks and tariffs are added overnight. Massive traffic jams could also be expected on highways leading to major ferry ports.\nThe complex maneuvering on dates comes as Britain's Parliament considers legislation designed to prevent such a \"no-deal\" departure.\nBritain's upper House of Lords is set to resume debate on the measure Monday. It was endorsed earlier by the lower House of Commons by just one vote.\nDespite the apparent support in Parliament for a new law to prevent a no-deal exit, the decision is in the hands of the EU, not Britain. It is the first country to try to leave the bloc, and the formal \"Article 50\" exit procedure has never been tested before. All 27 nations have to agree unanimously on an extension.\nThe Europeans would prefer that Britain not take part in the European Parliament elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.\nMay said in her letter that Britain is reluctantly ready to begin preparations for the European elections if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim. She said she is making the preparations even though she believes it is not in the interest of either Britain or the EU for her country to participate because it is leaving the bloc.\nMay's withdrawal plan, reached with the EU over more than two years of negotiations, has been rejected by the U.K. Parliament three times.\nShe is now seeking a compromise in a series of talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his deputies, with hopes of winning opposition support for a new divorce deal.\nThe talks do not seem to be advancing.

One of them, Mark Francois, said that if the U.K. remained in the bloc, \"then in return we will become a Trojan Horse within the EU.\"\nBritain hopes it won't be a member for too long, though.\n\"The key with any delay is we are able to terminate it once we ratify in order that we can then get on and get a deal through Parliament, ratify that agreement and leave the EU,\" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the BBC. \"That is what the EU leaders want, it is what the Prime Minister wants.\"\nEU Council President Donald Tusk and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker were already honing strategies with incoming leaders hours ahead of the evening summit.\nMay will have a pre-summit meeting in Brussels with Tusk before explaining her delay request to the leaders, who will then discuss their next move.\nIf they don't grant an extension, Britain leaves the bloc on Friday with no deal regulating the departure, unless it cancels Brexit independently. A drastic cliff-edge exit would have huge costs to businesses and trade across the English Channel and be very cumbersome to travelers as it would likely hit airports, ports, tariff rules and standard regulations overnight.\nEU countries, especially France, have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain about a way forward.\nThe bloc's leaders have tried to help May over two years of negotiations, even after she missed her hand-picked Brexit departure date on March 29 because of a parliamentary revolt.\nSeeking support from European heavyweights Tuesday, May flew to Berlin and Paris to plead for good terms with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been taking a tough stance ahead of the Brussels summit.\nMay's charm offensive appeared to bear fruit with an official in Macron's office saying that France was ready to accept a new delay.\nWhile Macron still has a long list of conditions, it was a notable shift in France's tone compared with last week. The reason for the change was unclear, though concerns have been growing about how badly a hard Brexit would hit the French economy, too. France was also encouraged by May's outreach last week to Britain's political opposition to find a compromise, and Macron may have been swayed in part by a meeting with the Irish prime minister.\nAmong conditions France is now setting to agree to a new delay: A \"credible prospect\" of some kind of solution to the British political deadlock; a promise that Britain won't keep asking for more delays; and guarantees that Britain would not be involved in future EU decisions while its Brexit drama is playing out.\n\"The longer the extension might be, the more guarantees are needed,\" the French official said, speaking on condition he not be named in keeping with presidential policy.\nEvery British initiative to get a deal has floundered so far. Several days of talks between May's Conservative government and the main opposition Labour Party aimed at finding a compromise Brexit deal have failed to produce a breakthrough. Labour favors a softer Brexit than the government has proposed, and wants to retain a close economic relationship with the bloc.\nAfter further talks Tuesday over an informal lunch of sandwiches and sausage rolls, the two sides said they would resume their discussions after Wednesday's EU summit.\n____"}, {"id": "156", "title": "May to ask Merkel and Macron for a Brexit extension as Parliament votes to block no-deal", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://www.newsstandhub.com/cnn/may-to-ask-merkel-and-macron-for-a-brexit-extension-as-parliament-votes-to-block-no-deal", "time_stamp": "2019:4:8 00:00:00", "content": "British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, as the UK leader prepares to request another Brexit extension from the European Union.\nEU leaders will meet Wednesday to discuss May's request to move the Brexit deadline, which is set for Friday, April 12.\nUK lawmakers finally approved a Brexit bill late Monday after weeks of failing to reach agreement on May's proposals or any of the alternative models of leaving the EU.\nThe bill, which received royal assent and is now law, aims to block a no-deal Brexit, whereby the UK crashes out of the EU without any transition arrangements in place.\nYvette Cooper, the Labour MP who introduced the bill to Parliament, said lawmakers had voted \"against the damage (and) chaos that no deal would cause for jobs, manufacturing, medicine supplies, policing (and) security.\"\nHowever, UK Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told CNN that no deal \"remains a possibility\" -- despite Parliament's determination that it should not happen.\nHe said cross-party talk needed to finish and reach \"a sensible conclusion about the best way to leave the EU with a deal.\"\nThose talks -- between May's Conservatives and Labour -- will continue Tuesday, despite the Prime Minister's absence, Downing Street confirmed.\n\"We are committed to finding a way through in order to ensure we can leave the EU and deliver on the referendum.

Members of Parliament have already rejected the deal twice -- first by a record 230, and last week by 149.\nMany officials are skeptical that May would be able to pass her deal a third time. But May insisted on Thusday night that she wanted her deal to pass.\nNote of contrition\nAfter a much-criticized speech in Downing Street on Wednesday, when she blamed British lawmakers for the Brexit impasse, May struck a note of contrition, conceding that she had been frustrated.

A spokesman also told CNN that Pindar, the UK's military bunker based under the Ministry of Defence, became \"operational\" on Monday as part of the operation.\nBusiness leaders and workers' representatives are furious that May has taken the UK so close to the edge of no deal.

The March date was a deadline the prime minister herself triggered when she - alongside the British Parliament - initiated Article 50 in the E.U. treaty two years ago.\nNow Britain almost certainly will not leave the European Union in two weeks - unless E.U. leaders reject its request for an extension and it crashes out with no deal. The vote to delay Brexit passed 412 to 202.\nAlso on Thursday, lawmakers voted against holding a second Brexit referendum, a complete do-over that could reverse the result of the historic June 2016 plebiscite.\nWhile many members of Parliament may ultimately back a second referendum - a highly contentious proposal marketed as a \"People's Vote\" - even supporters of the move withheld support Thursday, hoping instead to push the idea in tumultuous days to come.\nMay is offering lawmakers a stark choice: support her now twice-rejected Brexit deal in a third \"meaningful vote\" next week - dubbed MV3 - or face the prospect of a Brexit delay that could stretch far into the future, perhaps a year or more.\nChristopher Chope, a hard-line Brexiteer and fellow member of May's Conservative Party, confessed that he had felt May's cold steel. \"Instead of accepting the verdict of the House, she is stubbornly continuing to assert that her deal is a good deal. And now she is holding a pistol to our heads by threatening that we will lose Brexit altogether,\" he told the House of Commons on Thursday.\nThe clock ticks louder each day. May said that if the lawmakers back a Brexit deal by Wednesday - the day before a European summit - she will ask E.U. leaders for a \"one-off extension\" ending June 30. Those three months would be necessary to pass legislation in Britain and on the continent and to provide for an \"orderly Brexit.\"\nThe prime minister said that if the lawmakers reject her third attempt to win approval for her half-in, half-out compromise plan for Brexit, she would ask E.U. leaders for a longer delay. \nStaying in beyond June probably would require Britain, as one of the 28 E.U. member states, to hold European Parliament elections in May 2019.

The potential is unlimited!\"\nBut in a later meeting with the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House, Trump was critical of May's leadership.\n\"I'm surprised at how badly it's all gone from the standpoint of a negotiation,\" Trump said. \"I gave the prime minister my ideas on how to negotiate it, and I think you would have been successful. She didn't listen to that and that's fine - she's got to do what she's got to do. I think it could have been negotiated in a different manner, frankly. I hate to see everything being ripped apart now.\"\nEuropean leaders will have to decide what to do with Britain when they gather for two days in Brussels starting next Thursday. They are divided over how much rope to give.\nSome countries, especially France, feel that if a no-deal departure is going to happen anyway at the end of an extension, it would be preferable to face the pain sooner.\nOthers think a long extension would be best, so that voters do not blame mainstream leaders for whatever economic turmoil arises. Or they want to preserve good relations with a country that will continue to be an important trading and security partner even after its departure.\nDonald Tusk, president of the European Council, tweeted Thursday that he would urge E.U. leaders to support a \"long extension\" if Britain needed to \"rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it.\"\n\"Once they sort themselves out, I'm pretty sure the 27 will still be united on the next steps forward,\" European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans told Sky News. \"But many member states are saying, yes, you're talking about an extension, but to do what?\"\nPassions are high - as hard-line Brexiteers fear May's strategy will force them to accept a deal they don't like or risk losing their beloved Brexit. \nA headline in the Telegraph newspaper read: \"Britain's Remainer elites have declared war on democracy itself.\"\nMembers of May's party have been brazen in saying that a compromise deal could be crafted - but they beg the prime minister to drop her plan.\n\"There is a majority in this house for a Brexit deal.

European leaders and company executives have pushed the government to say when it plans to trigger Article 50 of the EU treaty, starting talks on the U.K.'s departure, so they can begin preparing for a post-EU Britain.\n\"We will invoke it when we are ready, and we will be ready soon,\" she said. \"We will invoke Article 50 no later than the end of March next year.\"\nWhile the prime minister had previously hinted that she planned to initiate Britain's exit early next year, many observers had speculated she would wait until the conclusion of France's presidential election in May or perhaps even the German elections in late summer or fall of next year.\nBut basking in the glow of party acolytes, a beaming May sounded as if she had campaigned for Britain to leave the EU all along - even though she had opposed that outcome before the June 23 referendum. In what sounded like a stump speech for \"leave,\" she hit on the emotive issues of sovereignty, immigration and world status.\nShe insisted there would be no unnecessary delays in bringing Brexit to pass - and that Britain would fight any legal challenges intended to derail the move. She sternly rejected the idea that the government would circumvent the result, making a face as she commented on those still fighting to stay.\nAnalysts said the deadline for starting the talks was welcome, but businesses still need more detail about what Brexit will mean for trade and immigration.\nWhile Britain seeks to control immigration from the EU, free movement of labor is a founding principle of the bloc. This means that any restrictions on immigration are likely to result in barriers to trade between Britain and the EU, said Jonathan Portes, a senior fellow at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research.\n\"That means continued uncertainty for businesses, both those who trade with the EU and those who employ EU nationals,\" Portes tweeted. \"What we cannot do is delude ourselves that we can 'have our cake and eat it.'\"\nIn addition to setting out her timetable, the prime minister said she would ask Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act, which automatically makes EU rules the law of the land in Britain. At the same time, the government will incorporate all EU laws into British law and then repeal measures as necessary on a case-by-case basis, she said.\n\"That means that the United Kingdom will be an independent, sovereign nation,\" she said. \"It will be making its own laws.\"\nMay said that by offering a timetable now, she hopes to encourage the EU to begin preliminary work that will help the negotiations go smoothly once they begin. EU leaders so far have rejected any such discussions.\nThe president of the 28-nation EU's governing European Council, Donald Tusk, offered support for her position. He had told her at a recent Downing Street meeting that the \"ball is now in your court.\"\n\"PM May's declaration brings welcome clarity on start of Brexit talks,\" he tweeted Sunday. \"Once Art. 50's triggered, EU27 will engage to safeguard its interests.\"\nOne of the biggest sticking points in any talks will be immigration.\nThe perception that EU immigrants have strained public services and changed the face of many communities was a factor for many British citizens who voted to leave the EU. May said that she intends to heed public opinion on that point.\n\"Apart from the message of leaving the European Union, I think there was also a clear message from the British people that they wanted us to control movement of people from the EU coming into the UK, so we will deliver on that,\" she said.\nMay also flatly rejected the idea that elements within the United Kingdom might be able to negotiate a deal for themselves. The message was clearly aimed at Scotland, which only narrowly rejected an independence move in 2014 and had voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. Scotland wants a place at the table because of its numerous trade ties with the EU.\n\"We will negotiate as one United Kingdom and we will leave the European Union as one United Kingdom. There is no opt-out for Brexit,\" May told the conference. \"I will never allow divisive nationalists to undermine the precious union between the four nations of our United Kingdom.\"\nCritics quickly pounced on the first tangible moves on the process in weeks. Conservative Anna Soubry, a former minister who is in the Tory pro-Europe wing of the party, told ITV that she was concerned that May would trigger the article so soon, warning that companies such as Nissan might leave without a deal on the single market.\n\"Triggering Brexit as early as March really concerns me, troubles me hugely, because we won't have had the French elections, we won't have had the German elections, and I'm sorry, it is going to take a lot of time and effort to disentangle ourselves and get the right deal,\" she said.\nThe opposition Labour Party asked for more clarity on the proposals.

We will decide for ourselves how we control immigration. And we will be free to pass our own laws.\u201d\nThat position strikes at the heart of the usual trade-off by countries that have unfettered access to Europe\u2019s internal market of about 500 million people, but that also accept the freedom of Europeans to cross frontiers and live and work in any member state.\nWhile Mrs. May said she wanted the \u201cmaximum\u201d scope for British companies to trade inside the European Union\u2019s single market, she added that Britain would not accept the right of European Union law to trump national legislation, another pillar of the single market.\nMrs. May also spoke of striking free-trade deals with new partners, suggesting that Britain would leave Europe\u2019s Customs Union, which lays down common tariffs but prevents member states from making independent arrangements with other countries.\nHer speech left many details unclear and undoubtedly represents a tough opening bid before next year\u2019s talks, which are likely to be complex and fraught with disagreement.\nShe argued that the country\u2019s new relationship with the European Union would be unique, and rejected the idea that there was a clear division between a \u201chard\u201d Brexit and a \u201csoft\u201d one with closer economic ties, although there are signs of deep differences within her cabinet on the issue.\nIdeally, Mrs. May would like to regain the ability to limit migration from the Continent while keeping full access to the European Union\u2019s single market.\nIn an interview in The Sun published on Saturday, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, argued that Britain\u2019s policy was \u201chaving our cake and eating it.\u201d\nYet across the English Channel, there has been no sign of compromise, and European politicians have made it clear that a trade-off is required from Britain.\nOver all, Mrs. May\u2019s speech suggested that she would emphasize the right to limit immigration even if that meant securing less favorable access to European markets.\nDavid Davis, the minister responsible for negotiating Brexit, underscored the position that trading arrangements were not the only, or even the most important, part of the British equation.\n\u201cWe want to maintain the freest possible trade between us, without betraying the instruction we have received from the British people to take back control of our own affairs,\u201d Mr. Davis told the convention.\nMrs. May insisted in her speech, the first of two to the convention, that Scotland would leave the European Union, too, and had \u201cno opt-out from Brexit.\u201d In the referendum that determined Britain\u2019s exit from the union, the majority of Scots voted to remain.\nShe also announced plans to start the domestic legislative process for Brexit next year by asking Parliament to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which allowed Britain to join the European Union\u2019s predecessor.\nAlthough this new legal step would not come into effect until Britain left the bloc, it would transfer European legislation, including laws to protect labor rights, into British law. Parliament would then be able to decide at a later point which laws to keep.\nIn a statement, Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the nation\u2019s main business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed that development but highlighted the anxieties of many companies.\n\u201cWith a rapid timetable pointing to an exit from the E.U. in spring 2019, businesses need to know the government\u2019s ambition on the fundamental issues of skills and barrier-free access to E.U. markets as soon as possible,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBusinesses cannot continue to operate in the dark,\u201d she added, because \u201cthe decisions they face today are real and pressing.\u201d\nThere have been warnings in recent weeks from manufacturers, including carmakers that fear they may face tariffs, and from financial services companies that worry about their ability to do business across Europe from London.\nCarlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, said last week that he would be unable to make investment decisions in Britain unless the government guaranteed compensation for any tariffs that might be imposed after Brexit.\nStill, the outcome of the June referendum was interpreted by many politicians, including Mrs. May, as a rejection of the European Union\u2019s policy of free movement of people, which has allowed hundreds of thousands from Southern and Eastern Europe to settle in Britain.\nMrs. May served as home secretary for six years and devoted much of that time to an ultimately ineffective attempt to reduce immigration.\nNormally, there would be no high-profile speeches on the opening Sunday of a Conservative convention, but party leaders hope to get the European Union issue out of the way so they can focus on less contentious subjects during the rest of the gathering, which will conclude on Wednesday.\nThe European Union aims to guarantee the free movement of goods, capital, services and people across its frontiers, and for many of Europe\u2019s policy makers, it would be a betrayal to allow Britain to enjoy the economic benefits while rejecting free movement of people.\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to give British people more rights than others outside the European Union.\nThe president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, has said that Britain should not be granted any special favors on single-market access and that \u201cany outcome should ensure that all participants are subject to the same rules.\u201d\nPHOTO: Prime Minister Theresa May speaking Sunday at the opening of her Conservative Party\u2019s convention in Birmingham, England.

Otherwise, the U.K. is facing a chaotic \"no-deal\" departure from the bloc within days, or a much longer delay that May says she will not allow while she is in power.\nMay, who has spent two and a half years trying to lead Britain out of the EU, said it was \"a matter of great personal regret\" that she had to seek a delay to Brexit.\nIn a televised statement from 10 Downing St., May said she shared the frustration felt by many Britons who have \"had enough\" of endless Brexit debates and infighting - though she did not accept a role in causing it. Instead, she blamed Parliament for the deadlock, and warned that if lawmakers did not back her deal it would cause \"irreparable damage to public trust.\"\n\"It is high time we made a decision,\" May said.\nIn a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, May acknowledged that the Brexit process \"clearly will not be completed before 29 March, 2019\" - the date fixed in law two years ago for Britain's departure.\nMay asked to delay Britain's withdrawal until June 30, and said she would set out her reasons to EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.\nHer longshot plan is to hold a third vote in Parliament on her deal next week, then use the EU-granted extension to pass the legislation needed for an orderly departure from the EU.\n\"As prime minister I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30,\" May told the House of Commons - a hint she could quit if Britain is forced to accept a longer pause.\nTusk said he thought a short delay to Brexit \"will be possible, but it would be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons.\"\nMay's request - and Tusk's response - leaves Britain and the bloc facing Brexit uncertainty right up to the deadline for departure. Withdrawing without a deal could mean huge disruptions for businesses and U.K. residents, as well as those in the 27 remaining EU countries.\n\"Even if the hope for a final success may seem frail, even illusory, and although Brexit fatigue is increasingly visible and justified, we cannot give up seeking until the very last moment a positive solution,\" Tusk said in Brussels.\nTusk made clear what other EU leaders have long hinted: The EU is unwilling to give Britain more time unless the government can find a way out of the Brexit impasse.\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that \"if the (EU) Council is to decide on extending the deadline for Britain, then we would like to know: Why, why, why?\"\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said a delay could only be granted if May guaranteed that its purpose \"is to finalize the ratification of the deal already negotiated.\"\nEU leaders are united in saying that the divorce deal it spent more than a year and a half negotiating with Britain can't be renegotiated.\nBut the deal has twice been rejected twice by hefty margins in Britain's Parliament, amid opposition from pro-Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers.\nMay had planned to try again this week to get the agreement approved, until the speaker of the House of Commons ruled that she can't ask Parliament to vote on the deal again unless it is substantially changed.\nMay told Tusk that despite the ruling \"it remains my intention to bring the deal back to the House.\" She's likely to do that next week - within days or hours of Britain's scheduled departure - by arguing that circumstances have changed and the speaker's bar on a third vote no longer applied.\nBut she faces a struggle to overturn the huge margins of defeat for her deal in previous votes in January and last week.\nTusk did not say whether the EU would be willing to grant a long delay to Brexit if Britain changed course and abandoned May's deal for a new approach.\nBritish opposition politicians, and pro-EU members of May's Conservative government, have urged a longer extension, saying a delay of just a few months could leave the country once again facing a no-deal Brexit this summer.\nThey want to commit to a close post-Brexit economic relationship with the bloc to ease disruption for businesses and citizens.\nOpposition Labour Party lawmaker Angela Eagle said May should \"stop banging her head against the brick wall of her defeated deal\" and seek cross-party support for a new Brexit strategy.\nBut a shift to \"soft Brexit\" would infuriate the pro-Brexit wing of May's divided party, and a long delay would require Britain to participate in May 23-26 elections for the European Parliament.\nMay said postponing Brexit beyond June would result in Parliament spending \"endless hours contemplating its navel on Brexit.\"\nAny delay that required Britain to take part in European parliamentary elections would be a major headache for the bloc. Britain's seats already have been allocated to other countries to fill in the May election.\nBritain believes it would not have to participate if it got a three-month delay, because the newly elected European parliament is not due to convene until July. Some EU officials take a different view and want any extension to end by May 23, the first day of the European elections.\nThe Brexit-fueled political chaos has drawn reactions ranging from sympathy to scorn at home and around the world. On its front page Wednesday, the Brexit-backing Daily Mail newspaper bemoaned the time since the referendum as \"1,000 lost days.\"\nJuncker said Britain's Parliament needed to decide whether it would approve the only deal that is on the table.\n\"If that doesn't happen, and if Great Britain does not leave at the end of March, then we are, I am sorry to say, in the hands of God,\" he said. \"And I think even God sometimes reaches a limit to his patience.\"\n___\nCook reported from Brussels.

She said the British public wanted them to \"get on with it\" and said it was \"high time\" for them to take a decision.\nCalling the delay to Brexit a \"matter of great personal regret,\" May said the British public \"have had enough\" and are tired of political infighting. \"So far Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice. All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want,\" she said.\nEarlier, May told the House of Commons she had written to European Council President Donald Tusk, asking for a three-month delay to Brexit, until June 30.\nTusk said in Brussels later that a short extension \"should be possible,\" but on one condition -- that the UK Parliament passes May's Brexit deal.\nJust last week the Prime Minister warned the House of Commons that a longer extension would be needed if lawmakers failed to vote in favor of her Brexit deal. Downing Street hoped that the prospect of a long delay would force rebel lawmakers into line.\nBut Brexiteer members of her Cabinet were reportedly furious at the suggestion May could ask the EU for a delay of up to two years. There was a mutinous mood at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, according to multiple reports.\nBy Wednesday morning, May had backed down.\nThe Prime Minister told the House of Commons later that she intends to bring her twice-rejected deal back for third vote. \"If that vote is passed, the extension will give the House time to consider the Withdrawal Agreement bill. If not, the House will have to decide how to proceed,\" May said.\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the UK's main opposition Labour Party, said May has led the country into a \"full-scale national crisis.\"\n\"Incompetence, failure and intransigence from the Prime Minister have brought us to this point,\" he told MPs.\nHe promised to hold his own meetings with UK lawmakers on Wednesday and leaders in Brussels on Thursday in order to \"break the deadlock.\" However, in a sign of the political paralysis gripping Westminster, Corbyn walked out of one of the meetings when he found that a breakaway former Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, was present.\nMay to discuss extension options in Brussels\nAmid the chaos, May will meet EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday where she will discuss her request to extend Article 50 -- the legal process for Britain leaving the bloc.\nIf an extension is agreed by EU leaders, the UK will avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal.\nHowever European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had \"formally warned\" May against delaying Brexit beyond May 23, spokesman Margaritis Schinas said.\n\"The Withdrawal has to be complete before the 23rd May otherwise we risk facing institutional difficulties and legal uncertainty given the European Elections' date,\" Schinas added.\nThe UK appears to think that, since the new session of the European Parliament doesn't begin until July 1, it can remain in the EU until June 30 without holding elections. An internal European Commission briefing document, seen by CNN, states that the UK must leave by May 23 to avoid holding elections.\nTusk acknowledged that May's proposed end date June 30 \"creates a series of questions of a legal and political nature\" that would have to be debated, he said.\nEarlier on Wednesday Juncker hinted that leaders may be forced to put off a formal decision on May's request to another, emergency summit next week.\n\"We will probably have to meet again next week, because Mrs May has not got agreement for anything either in her Cabinet or her Parliament,\" he told German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk on Wednesday.\nJuncker also reiterated that the EU would not enter any more negotiations with the British Prime Minister. \"We are not in a state of war with the UK, but a state of negotiation [and] the negotiations are finished,\" he said, according to PA.\nThe Prime Minister's Brexit timetable was thrown into turmoil last week when the Speaker of the House of Commons, thwarted her plans to hold another vote on her deal this week."}], "4": [{"id": "136", "title": "UK's Cameron says leaving EU would be 'economic self-harm'", "publisher": "The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-uks-cameron-says-leaving-eu-would-be-economic-self-harm-2016-6", "time_stamp": "2016:6:3 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON (AP) - Leaving the European Union would be an act of \"economic self-harm,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday during a televised grilling that saw him challenged on the emotive topic of immigration and accused of scaremongering about the impact of quitting the 28-nation bloc.\nThree weeks before British voters decide whether to stay in the EU, Cameron was pressed on the repercussions for immigration, security and the economy as he fielded questions from a journalist and audience members during a lively Sky News program.\nCameron's Conservative government says it aims to reduce net annual migration to less than 100,000 - but last year it was more than 330,000, roughly half of it from other EU nations.\nHe insisted that Britain can use curbs to welfare benefits and other measures to control migrant numbers while remaining in the bloc, even though citizens of all EU nations have the right to live and work in other member states.\n\"There are good ways of controlling migration and there are bad ways,\" Cameron said.\n\"It would be madness to try to do that by trashing our economy and pulling out of the single market.\"\nThe referendum campaign is growing increasingly heated as widely varying polls suggest an unpredictable result. The \"leave\" side is stressing the pressure that EU immigrants have put on British jobs and public services, while \"remain\" campaigners seek to keep the focus on the economic uncertainty that U.K. exit - known as \"Brexit\" - would wreak.\nMany voters have expressed frustration at all the claims and counterclaims, and Thursday's studio audience - selected to include pro-and anti-EU voters, as well as undecideds - was sometimes vocally skeptical of Cameron. One young woman accused the prime minister of \"waffling\" in response to her question about whether Turkey would join the bloc.\nCameron said leaving the EU's single market of 500 million people - with which Britain does almost half its trade - would hurt the British economy, and negotiating new trade deals could take a decade.\nHe said tumbling out of the single market \"would be an act of economic self-harm,\" and rebuffed claims that he was scaremongering.\n\"I am genuinely worried about what would happen if we leave,\" he said.\nCameron also denied using hyperbole when he claimed last month that a Brexit would increase the risk of European war.\n\"On our continent in the last century, twice we had an enormous bloodbath between our nations,\" he said. \"Can we be so confident that we have solved all of Europe's problems and all of Europe's tensions?\"\nThe Vote Leave campaign said the audience's skepticism \"showed the public doesn't trust Cameron.\"\n\"All he had was a single bogus argument - that we have to be in the EU to trade with Europe, which is simply untrue,\" chief executive Matthew Elliott said.\nOther members of the EU are also weighing in as referendum day looms, with a mix of entreaties to stay and warnings of the risk of a Brexit.\nGermpotan Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that Britain would get better results from the EU \"when you sit at the bargaining table,\" rather than if it were lobbying from outside.\nCameron conceded that he often found dealings with the EU frustrating."}, {"id": "143", "title": "David Cameron, Urging Against 'Brexit,' Focuses on Security", "publisher": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/world/europe/david-cameron-brexit.html", "time_stamp": "2016:5:10 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain warned on Monday that isolationism has historically led to war in Europe and urged his country to stay in the European Union, saying it has helped keep the Continent at peace.\nHis argument, by focusing on security and not just economics, brought his campaign to persuade his country to remain in the 28-nation bloc into a new phase. \n  The European Union ''has helped reconcile countries which were at each other's throats for decades,'' Mr. Cameron said, and Britain ''has a fundamental national interest in maintaining common purpose in Europe to avoid future conflict between European countries.''\n  While he said he recognized that some Britons' ''heads and hearts are torn,'' Mr. Cameron said that threats from a ''newly belligerent Russia'' and from the Islamic State meant that cooperation and ''unity of purpose'' with allies were vital to the nation's security interests.\n  The referendum on a British withdrawal from the European Union, known as ''Brexit,'' is scheduled for June 23, and Mr. Cameron's speech, which was widely previewed in the British news media and delivered at the British Museum, was timed to precede a competing address from Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who is a leader of the campaign to leave the bloc.\n  Mr. Johnson, free of mayoral duties, said that Mr. Cameron had failed to bring home significant overhauls of the European Union, which is ''ratchet-hauling us ever further into a federal structure'' that is more centralized and unitary. He charged that European leaders were using ''subterfuge'' for their integrationist plans to create a country called ''Europe,'' and that Britain, as a trading nation, would have no trouble replicating trade deals with the world, including with the nations of the Commonwealth.\n  In a Johnsonian flourish, he concluded, ''We will win for exactly the same reason that the Greeks beat the Persians at Marathon -- because they are fighting for an outdated absolutist ideology and we are fighting for freedom.''\n  The government also seized on the admission on Sunday by Michael Gove, the intellectual leader of the campaign to leave, that a British exit from the bloc would also mean leaving the single market of the European Union. Mr. Gove, who is also the justice minister, ruled out a deal like the one that Norway has, which gives the country duty-free access to the 500 million consumers of the European Union in return for financial contributions to the bloc's budget and agreements to allow European Union citizens freedom of travel and labor.\n  One of the strongest arguments of the campaign to leave centers on immigration: Only if Britain is free of the Brussels bureaucracy, the argument goes, can it truly control its borders. That is why Mr. Gove ruled out the Norway model, although the campaign to leave has not been consistent on this issue. Mr. Gove asserts that Britain could retain duty-free access to the bloc, which some European Union member states have said would not be possible.\n  George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer and the most powerful government official after the prime minister, said that Mr. Gove's plan ''would be catastrophic for people's jobs, their incomes and their livelihoods.'' Mr. Osborne said that ''some people think wrecking the economy is a price worth paying -- I absolutely reject that.'' On Monday, Mr. Cameron called Mr. Gove's plan ''reckless and irresponsible.''\n  The Gove-Osborne clash dominated coverage in The Financial Times, which editorialized that ''Brexit is too high a price to pay over migration.''\n  Most other newspapers, like The Times of London, focused on early excerpts from the Cameron speech. That newspaper published its story under the headline: ''Brexit will raise risk of world war, PM claims.''\n  Paul Waugh, in the British edition of The Huffington Post, wrote that Mr. Cameron's speech was more subtle, but that he ''won't be upset with the bloodcurdling headlines.''\n  Proponents of leaving the bloc have argued that the campaign to remain has been resorting to a ''Project Fear'' to scare voters into staying.\n  Daniel Hannan, a British member of the European Parliament who favors leaving the bloc, said on Twitter: ''Remainers like to think of themselves as sensible moderates. But this hysterical language is coming from their side.''\n  In another bit of political symbolism, Mr. Cameron was introduced on Monday by David Miliband, a former foreign secretary who in 2010 lost a Labour Party leadership contest to his brother, Ed. Ed Miliband then lost last May's general election and quit, replaced by a left-wing activist, Jeremy Corbyn.\n  David Miliband, who now runs the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian group based in New York, returned to Britain to urge voters to remain in the European Union. He called leaving ''political suicide.'' On Sunday, he gave a speech in Sunderland, in northeastern England, saying that the manufacturing jobs of the region would suffer if Britain were to leave the bloc.\n  He called the campaign to leave the bloc ''Project Fantasy,'' saying that the argument that Britain could renegotiate its own trade deals with large countries is ''risible.''\n  He said his ''temporary political alliance'' with Mr. Cameron stemmed from their agreement on the importance of the issue."}], "42": [{"id": "147", "title": "President Donald Trump arrives to Britain in 'turmoil'", "publisher": "USA TODAY", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/12/president-donald-trump-uk-visit-london/778124002/", "time_stamp": "2018:7:13 00:00:00", "content": "Jane Onyanga-Omara, USA TODAYPublished 9:40 a.m. ET July 12, 2018 |\u00a0Updated 6:13 p.m. ET July 12, 2018\nLONDON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived at the opulent\u00a0Blenheim Palace\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the birthplace of wartime leader Winston Churchill\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for a black-tie business\u00a0dinner on Thursday, the evening of Trump's\u00a0first visit\u00a0to the United Kingdom as president.\u00a0\nThe couple were welcomed at the palace\u00a0in Oxfordshire\u00a0\u2014\u00a0about 60 miles outside of London\u00a0\u2014 by Prime Minister Theresa May\u00a0and her husband Philip, before witnessing\u00a0a\u00a0performance by\u00a0the Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards military bands.\u00a0Anti-Trump protesters lined the road\u00a0up to the building, but it is unlikely the Trumps\u00a0\u2014 who arrived via helicopter\u00a0\u2014\u00a0saw them.\n\"Time and again, the common threads that hold us together \u2014\u00a0our shared history, our shared values, our shared language and culture \u2014\u00a0conspire to inspire mutual respect, and to make the United States and the United Kingdom not just the closest of allies, but the dearest of friends,\" May said at the dinner, according to excerpts from her speech released before the event. She added\u00a0that\u00a0more than a million Americans work for British firms.\n\"Now, as we prepare to leave the European Union, we have an unprecedented opportunity to do more,\" she said. \"It\u2019s an opportunity to reach a free trade agreement that creates jobs and growth here in the U.K. and right across the United States.\"\nMay is eager to secure a trade deal with the U.S. after the U.K. departs the EU next year.\nWoody Johnson, the U.S. ambassador to the U.K., said last week that Trump\u00a0\"knows how important the special relationship (with the U.K.) is firsthand and that's why the bust of Churchill is actually in the Oval Office as we speak.\u00a0This is not an accident.\"\nTrump's working visit comes\u00a0days after he said the nation was \u201cin somewhat turmoil\" following the resignations of two senior government figures over Brexit.\u00a0\nThe Trumps landed Thursday afternoon local time at Stansted Airport, 40 miles northeast of the British capital.

Trump\u00a0smiled but did not say a word.\u00a0White House Chief of Staff\u00a0John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton followed close\u00a0 behind.\nThe Trumps\u00a0participated in a meet and greet at the\u00a0new $1 billion U.S. Embassy\u00a0on the banks of the River Thames on Thursday. Trump has previously described the high-tech embassy\u00a0as\u00a0a \u201cbad deal.\u201d\nLarge scale protests expected here and across Britain\u00a0prompted\u00a0authorities to \u00a0add extra security.\u00a0\u00a0The U.S. Embassy\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0warned Americans in the capital\u00a0to keep a low profile.\nTens of thousands of protesters plan to rally against Trump's four-day trip in London on Friday. Protests are also planned at locations including Windsor, where Trump will\u00a0meet with Queen Elizabeth II. Since\u00a0the president will travel\u00a0by helicopter to locations, it\u00a0is unlikely he'll\u00a0actually see the demonstrations.\nA poll by market research firm YouGov published this week said 74% of Britons believed Trump was sexist, 63% thought he was racist, and 38% thought he was a strong leader. Another YouGov\u00a0poll released shortly before Trump's arrival said\u00a0half of Britons thought\u00a0the visit should go ahead, and 37% thought\u00a0it should be cancelled.\nTrump\u00a0said at a news conference at the NATO summit in Brussels shortly before he left for Britain\u00a0that he had no problem with the protests.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fine, I think they like me a lot in the U.K., I think they agree with me on immigration,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have Brexit in the first place, because of immigration.\u201d\u00a0\nHigh levels of immigration and a desire for sovereignty were some of the reasons that Britons voted 52% to 48% to leave the 28-member European Union\u00a0in a historic referendum in 2016.\nTrump questioned May's plans for leaving the EU.\u00a0\u201cThe people voted to break it up, so I imagine that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do. But maybe they\u2019re taking a little bit of a different route, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what they voted for,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked for his views on Brexit, which he has previously backed, Trump said \u201cit\u2019s not for me to say what they should be doing in the UK. I would say Brexit is Brexit. The people vote to break it up so I would imagine that\u2019s what they\u2019d do. I just want the people to be happy.\u00a0They\u2019re great people.\u201d\nMay published a white paper of her Brexit\u00a0plan Thursday, days after\u00a0the resignations of Boris Johnson as foreign secretary and David Davis as Brexit secretary. The pair quit over May\u2019s proposals to retain close trade ties with the EU after the U.K. leaves the alliance in March 2019\u00a0. Trump\u00a0told reporters ahead of his Europe trip that\u00a0he got along \"very well\" with May and that Johnson is a \"friend of mine.\"\nJohnson and Davis' resignations have added pressure for May to step down over her handling of Brexit as prime minister.\nAmnesty International hung\u00a0a 50 foot-long banner emblazoned with the words \u201cHuman Rights Nightmare\u201d and a large image of Trump on a bridge close to the new U.S. embassy.\nThe Bow Group, a conservative British think tank, said it would host a rally in parliament \u00a0to back Trump.\u00a0 The organization said speakers will include pro-Brexit politician Nigel Farage \u2014\u00a0an associate of Trump\u2019s.\nTrump on Friday holds talks on foreign policy with May at Chequers, the prime minister\u2019s country home in Buckinghamshire \u2013 47 miles outside London \u2013 before meeting the queen at Windsor Castle \u2013 26 miles from the capital.\nTrump and the first lady then spend the weekend in Scotland, where Trump said he will visit his Turnberry golf course."}, {"id": "159", "title": "Trump visits UK amid acrimonious relationship with London", "publisher": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-visits-uk-amid-acrimonious-relationship-london/story?id=56382976", "time_stamp": "2018:7:13 00:00:00", "content": "Even with an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II, President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0and first lady\u00a0Melania Trump\u00a0arrived at London Stansted airport for the American leader's first official visit to the U.K. Thursday morning amid an expected surge in protests.\nAccording to his itinerary at this point, his only formal event in London \u2013 where his unpopularity is high \u2013 is a closed press meet and greet at the U.S. embassy on Thursday. Otherwise, he will remain on the outskirts of the city center \u2013 which, in some ways, lessens the chance he'll encounter displays of British criticism of his policies directly.\nThe trek, coming more than a year and a half into his presidency, does not have the trappings of a state visit. Still, activists, members of Parliament, and the mayor of London are angry about their American guest.\nThe president\u2019s visit comes after his participation in the NATO summit in Brussels,\u00a0Belgium. At the NATO headquarters, Trump addressed his relations with the U.K. and insisted that it \"loves [him].\"\n\u201cThe U.K. loves me, in fact my mother was from the U.K., they love me there even if they are not treating us well with trades, but they will,\" he said. \"They like me a lot in the U.K.\"\nWidespread protests opposing President Trump\u2019s stay begin Thursday evening and continue through Friday night.

The\u00a0blimp, which depicts the president as a giant, orange child in a diaper, will fly over Parliament for two hours on Thursday.\nThe 2004 Green Day hit, \"American Idiot\" is now skyrocketing to the top of the U.K. charts ahead of the visit - a boost fueled in large part by the efforts of British protesters and social media.\nA coalition known as\u00a0Together Against Trump\u00a0has been the chief organizer of the opposition effort. In a statement, the group said it was a \u201cvictory that Donald Trump does not appear to have any official engagements in London.\u201d\n\u201cInstead he will stay hidden away in country estates and castles,\u201d the statement read.\nU.K. prime minister\u00a0Theresa May\u00a0will not attend any demonstrations but she has been critical of her American counterpart. Just a few weeks ago, she called the Trump administration\u2019s zero tolerance\u00a0immigration\u00a0policy \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\u201cThe pictures of children being held in what appear to be cages are deeply disturbing,\u201d May stated to the House of Commons.\nThe president\u2019s trip follows the NATO summit. After arriving in Great Britain Thursday evening, Trump and the first lady will dine with May and her husband at Blenheim Palace. On Friday, the two leaders will participate in a bilateral meeting and joint press conference. Trump will then meet the Queen at Windsor Castle.\nAlthough this is Trump\u2019s first official visit to the U.K., he has been invited before.\nLike this go-round, protesters promised widespread backlash back in February amid the president\u2019s plans to travel to London for the grand-opening of a new U.S. embassy. When Trump canceled his plans a few weeks before the big day, some \u2013 like London Mayor Sadiq Khan \u2013 speculated that the expected opposition scared off Trump and was happy about it.\n\u201cIt appears that President Trump got the message from the many Londoners who love and admire America and Americans but find his policies and actions the polar opposite of our city\u2019s values of inclusion, diversity, and tolerance,\u201d mayor Khan said in January. \u201cHis visit...would, without doubt, have been met by mass peaceful protests.\u201d\nThe president, in contrast, claimed that he called off his trip because of his predecessor\u2019s decision to sell the old embassy for \u201cpeanuts,\" a \u201cbad deal\u201d in his eyes.\nIn June of last year, Trump mocked Khan for his handling of the\u00a0London\u00a0Bridge terror attack and called him \u201cpathetic.\u201d The incident resulted in seven deaths and more than 50 injuries.\nKhan responded to Trump\u2019s pointed tweets in a television appearance on\u00a0BBC.\n\u201cSome people thrive on feud and division.

But he largely blamed the Sun, Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper, for leaving out the positive things he'd said about May. The interview overshadowed much of his first official trip to Britain in capitalized headlines and a torrent of TV coverage.\n\"When I saw her this morning, I said, 'I want to apologize because I said such good things about you,' \" Trump related during a joint news conference at the prime minister's country home, Chequers. \"She said, 'Don't worry, it's only the press.' I thought that was very - I thought that was very professional.\"\nTrump backed away from his criticism of how May is handling Britain's exit from the European Union. He said she had disregarded his advice to be more \"brutal.\" But he acknowledged that Brexit is a \"very complicated negotiation and not an easy negotiation, that's for sure.\"\n\"Whatever you're going to do is okay with us. Just make sure we can trade together,\" Trump said.\nMay also downplayed Trump's remarks in the Sun, even while her staff was stunned and members of her party complained about how rude a guest Trump was.\nMay told the gathered reporters: \"Lots of people give me advice about how to negotiate with the European Union. My job is actually getting out there and doing it, and that's exactly what I've done.\"\nTrump and May visited a military base early Friday and had lunch at Chequers. Then he left to have tea with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. \nThe body language of that highly symbolic meeting was always going to be closely scrutinized. It didn't go without notice that, even though it's not mandatory, that Trump and the first lady did not bow or curtsy when they greeted the queen. Later, during an inspection of guardsmen, Trump momentarily eclipsed the queen, moving in front of her and then stopping, apparently looking to see where she was. The queen navigated her way around him. The British press was divided over whether Trump simply stumbled over a bit of royal stagecraft or breached protocol.\nTrump is deeply unpopular in Britain and has largely avoided London, where a large blimp mocking him flew above mass protests Friday.\nStill, his comments in the Sun caused May intense embarrassment in a week when her cabinet is beset by division, her compromise plan to exit the European Union is being excoriated by her domestic critics and rebels in her Conservative Party are threatening a no-confidence vote.\nShe had been looking to Trump in this visit to help her sell her Brexit plan by promising generous bilateral trade deals for Britain after it leaves the European Union.\nThe Sun interview seemed to dash those hopes. Trump was quoted saying that if May followed through on her compromise Brexit plan, maintaining close ties to the European Union, \"that would probably end a major trade relationship with the United States.\"\nBut at the news conference Friday, Trump affirmed, \"We want to trade with the U.K., and the U.K. wants to trade with us.\"\nHe added, \"I give our relationship with the U.K., in terms of grade, the highest level of special.\"\nMay's advisers said that the news conference was a welcome relief - and that the trip was salvaged from disaster.\nTrump still reiterated his praise for Boris Johnson, May's rival, who resigned as foreign secretary this week in protest over May's Brexit approach. Trump explained his comments to the Sun about Johnson in terms of himself, as he often does.\n\"I said he'll be a great prime minister. He's been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as president,\" Trump said.\nJohnson last month said that Trump would do a better job than May has done negotiating Brexit.\nTrump and May, who were seen holding hands while strolling around the country estate as farm animals brayed in the distance, differed in both substance and style in the news conference.\nTrump, whose wife is a European immigrant to the United States, reiterated his claim that immigration - legal or otherwise, he did not say - is hurting Europe. He also argued that U.S. laws on immigration are too weak and said, \"We have laws that are so bad I don't even call them laws.\"\n\"It's changing the culture; I think it's a very negative thing for Europe,\" he said, noting that it was not politically correct to say so, \"but I'll say it, and I'll say it loud.\"\nMay, standing at a lectern beside Trump, disagreed. \"Overall immigration has been good for the U.K.,\" she said. \"It's brought people with different backgrounds, different outlooks here to the U.K., and has - and we've seen them contributing to our society and to our economy.\"\nThe two have previously squabbled over immigration, as recently as the Group of Seven meeting last month in Canada, aides said. \nTrump again blasted German Chancellor Angela Merkel for working with Russia on a natural-gas pipeline, following his incendiary charge at the NATO meeting in Brussels this week that Germany was \"captive to Russia.\"\n\"I think it's a horrible thing that Germany's doing,\" he said. \nMay said only that the project would be discussed further within the European Union.\nTrump was meandering, combative and inaccurate in many of his answers - attacking \"fake news\" CNN, referencing his uncle \"John Trump at MIT\" to crow about his understanding of nuclear weapons and repeatedly lampooning President Barack Obama, his predecessor. He again falsely stated that he had predicted Brexit one day before it happened, while visiting his Turnberry golf club, and said that the United States was responsible for 90 percent of NATO spending. (The United States accounted for 68.7 percent of NATO members' combined defense spending last year, reflecting its superpower status and 3.57 percent of gross domestic product.) Trump also overstated the trade deficit with China and the number of troops in Germany.\nMay was far more precise and short in her answers, did not attack political foes or the media and was determined to avoid all criticism of Trump - even as she faced nonstop questions about his dismissals of her.\nTrump said he plans to raise a range of topics in his summit Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, including nuclear proliferation, which Trump said he considers the largest problem facing the world.\nHe declined to say whether he would make a deal with Putin on Syria. Some are fearful that Trump will pull troops out of the region.\nThe president also pledged to raise the issue of election meddling during the summit and said he would tell Putin not to interfere in future U.S. elections.\n\"I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,' \" Trump said. \"There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think, but you never know what happens, right?\"\nHe said \"we'll see\" about Crimea, which Putin illegally annexed in 2014 to the derision of the world. Trump said again that he thought he could get along with Putin. \n\"This was an Obama disaster. And I think if I were president then, he would not have taken over Crimea,\" Trump said, fending off a tough question about Putin's annexation - the main point of contention for NATO allies - by blaming his predecessor. \nseung-min.kim@washpost.com\njosh.dawsey@washpost.com\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com"}], "60": [{"id": "157", "title": "EU gives Britain a Brexit delay and warns: 'Do not waste this time'", "publisher": "CNN.com", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/uk/brexit-delay-eu-gbr-intl/index.html", "time_stamp": "2019:4:10 00:00:00", "content": "The European Union has forced Britain to accept a six-month delay to the intractable Brexit process, with an option to leave earlier if the UK Parliament can agree a deal, at a tense summit of divided European leaders in Brussels.\nAfter a working dinner that dragged long into the evening, leaders of the 27 remaining nations agreed another delay to Britain's scheduled withdrawal from the EU, this time until October 31. European leaders were unconvinced by Prime Minister Theresa May's promise that the UK would get its house in order to leave by the end of June.\nBut the deal was only reached after six hours of horse trading that saw European leaders divided over how to deal with Britain's ongoing political crisis. President of the European Council Donald Tusk, who had originally proposed an extension of up to a year, confirmed the UK had accepted the deal.\n\"This extension is as flexible as I expected and a little bit shorter than I expected, but it is still enough to find the best possible solution,\" he told reporters in Brussels. And he had a stark warning for British politicians who have been deadlocked for months: \"Please do not waste this time.\"\nMay had sought a shorter delay to June 30 in order to avoid the UK crashing out without a deal later this week. The UK was meant to leave the EU on March 29, this was later extended to April 12.\nThe new extension, which falls on Halloween, means that Britain will more than likely have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May 23, nearly three years after the British people voted to leave the EU. May has always said she never wanted the UK to take part in those elections.\nThe fright night deadline, a day before the new European Commission is due to take office, was the product of grueling debate.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, whose patience has worn thin and wants to get on with his own project of reforming the EU, had advocated for a shorter Brexit extension, while the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, argued the delay should be extended.\nIt is understood that Macron originally didn't see any reason to grant Britain a delay beyond the end of June, but was persuaded to accept the October deadline.\nMacron did manage to force the other leaders to agree to a review process at the end of June, when Britain will be assessed on assurances that it will remain a constructive partner in EU business, even if it is on the way out of the bloc.\nSpeaking in the early hours of Friday, after the summit ended, Tusk hinted at the divisions, saying that despite their differing positions it was still \"easier to find unity here than in the House of Commons.\"\n\"Until the end of this period, the UK will also have the possibility to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit altogether,\" Tusk said, noting that the delay allowed the UK to \"reconsider\"' its Brexit strategy.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said there would \"probably\" be European elections held in the UK, which \"may seem a bit odd, but rules are rules.\"\nIf the UK does not take part in the European Parliament elections in late May it would be required to leave on June 1 without a deal, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Twitter.\nThe European leaders will reconvene in June to take stock.\nLondon deadlock\nWhile the European Union's decision to grant a so-called \"flextension\" allows the UK to leave as soon as it's ready, the optics aren't great for the Theresa May.\nThe prime minister suggested in a news conference following the summit that she could still manage to get her Withdrawal Agreement passed through Parliament in time to avoid the UK taking part in the European elections.\nIf the UK can agree a deal by May 22, the country will not have to hold European elections.\n\"I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension,\" May said, repeating that the UK must leave in a \"smooth and orderly way.\"\nThe longer delay reflects doubts among EU leaders that May can succeed in swiftly winning cross-party support for her withdrawal agreement, which members of parliament have rejected three times.\nIt will also infuriate hardliners within her own Conservative Party, who view any further delay as a path to a softer Brexit, or a signal that leaving the EU may never materialize at all.\nHardline Brexiteers have indicated that, should the UK remain stuck in the union, then it will \"become a Trojan horse within the EU,\" using British members of the European Parliament to create difficulties with key issues like the budget. That is a risk that the European leaders seem to have provided for.\nDraft conclusions from the meeting, seen by CNN, instructed Britain not to interfere with the processes of the EU, with assurances aimed at satisfying Macron.\nJuncker rebuked rumors that Britain would be a difficult partner should it find itself in the European Parliament, saying: \"That's nothing new.\" He added that Britain's ability to block EU decisions was very limited.\nThe extra breathing space granted by the EU also comes with the express instruction that the Brexit deadlock in London needs to be broken.\nIt seems unlikely, given that cross party talks between the UK's Labour and Conservative parties have led nowhere. Sticking points seem to be the UK remaining in a customs union after Brexit, which Labour backs, but it's still divided on whether to ask British voters to ratify any deal in a second referendum.\nThe Irish backstop, a provision to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, also has to be resolved.\nMay said that further talks will take place with the opposition in the coming days.\n\"I do not pretend that the next few weeks will be easy or that there is a simple way to break the deadlock,\" she added.\nBut it remains to be seen whether May will last long enough to see her deal through in any shape or form."}], "51": [{"id": "180", "title": "May wins confidence vote a day after Brexit plan's defeat", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/theresa-may-expected-to-survive-confidence-vote-even-after-brexit-failure/2019/01/16/80863074-1914-11e9-b8e6-567190c2fd08_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:1:17 00:00:00", "content": "Some see her  survival as    sign no one else has a solution to the crisis \nLONDON - Prime Minister Theresa May survived a no-confidence motion in the House of Commons on Wednesday evening, in a close party-line vote of 325 to 302, a day after the humiliating defeat of her Brexit plan imperiled both her leadership and Britain's departure from the European Union.\nNormally, a British leader who the previous day had so badly lost a vote on her government's most important legislation - by 432 to 202, the worst parliamentary loss in a century - might be expected to resign or be swept away. But these are not normal times.\nBrexit is tearing British society and its political classes apart as the sides devolve into warring tribes of \"leavers\" and \"remainers,\" neither with enough power to best the other.\n\"I think it's astonishing she is carrying on as prime minister,\" said Jonathan Tonge, a politics professor at the University of Liverpool. \"Not just because of the size of the defeat, but also because she told us that this was the 'best and only deal.' So, by definition, any course she pursues now is an inferior course.\"\nMay now must return to Parliament on Monday to present lawmakers with some sort of Plan B for exiting the 28-member union. Yet the deep disagreements over how and whether Britain should leave the European bloc persist.\nIn Brussels, European diplomats said that the onus was on British lawmakers to come up with a proposal - any proposal - that could win a majority in Westminster, so that there could be a basis for continued talks between the sides in Brussels. European leaders expressed impatience - and growing dread - that Britain was rushing toward the edge of the Brexit cliff on March 29 with no safety nets in place.\nIn brief remarks outside her official residence at 10 Downing Street, May said she understood if people outside Parliament found the previous 24 hours \"unsettling.\"\n\"Now MPs have made clear what they don't want, we must all work constructively together to set out what Parliament does want,\" she said, adding that she had invited the leaders of all parties to meet with her to try to hammer out a deal that could pass a bitterly divided House of Commons.\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who initiated the confidence motion against the government, had so far refused her overture, May said.\nLabour leaders insisted that May first rule out a \"no-deal\" Brexit, which they say would wreak havoc in Britain.\n\"Before there can be any positive discussions about the way forward, the government must remove, clearly and once and for all, the prospect of the catastrophe of no-deal and all the chaos that would come as a result of that,\" Corbyn said.\nLeaders of the Scottish National Party have been in discussions with May this week but said that avoiding a no-deal Brexit, extending the deadline for leaving the E.U., and consideration of a second Brexit referendum \"have to be on the table\" as options.\nMay said again in Parliament on Wednesday that she would not support a second referendum.\nWithin May's Conservative Party, too, factions have put down markers.\nThe hard-line wing of Tory Brexiteers published a plan Wednesday for leaving the E.U. with no deal and trading with Europe as a third country.\nAlthough a third of Conservative Party members on Tuesday voted against the withdrawal agreement May negotiated with European leaders, and even though Conservatives challenged her leadership in a party-only confidence vote just last month, Conservatives supported her in the confidence vote involving the whole House of Commons on Wednesday. \nTim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, said May is still standing, in part, because no one else in her party wants to take over at the Brexit helm.\n\"Who else is there? Who wants to take on this role?\" Bale said. \"No hard Brexiteer wants to, because they know, in their heart of hearts, it can't be done and they don't want to be blamed for it. And anyone else would have to come from a soft Brexit perspective and would end up splitting the party.\"\nBesides not having an obvious leader waiting in the wings, the Tories do not want a general election against Labour.\nThe sparring between the parties during the day-long debate over May's fate on Wednesday was punctuated by withering rhetoric and sharp thrusts.\nTom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, was somber but gripping: \"432 to 202,\" he said, citing the result of the vote in which May's Brexit plan was defeated. \"Mr. Speaker, that is not a mere flesh wound.\"\n\"No one doubts her determination, which is generally an admirable quality,\" Watson said of May. \"But, misapplied, it can be toxic.\"\nConservatives sought to turn the tables with a rip-roaring speech from Michael Gove, the environment secretary. Gove laid into Corbyn: \"He wants to leave NATO. He wants to get rid of our nuclear deterrent. And recently in a speech he said, 'Why do countries boast about the size of their armies? That is quite wrong. Why don't we emulate Costa Rica that has no army at all?' No allies. No deterrent. No army. No way can this country ever allow that man to be our prime minister.\" \nThe Conservative benches roared with delight.\nFor his part, Corbyn said May was running a \"zombie government,\" raising the specter of the undead prime minister repeating over and over again that \"Brexit means Brexit\" while devouring the brains of her party.\n\"Brexit is like a black hole that devours all light,\" Labour's Angela Eagle said.\nPhillip Lee, a Conservative Party member who resigned as a minister because he opposed May's deal, asked the prime minister whether she accepts that she may now have to change her approach to Brexit.\nMay did not say yes, but she did not say no.\nNicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party, told the BBC that she spoke with May after the defeat of her Brexit bill. Sturgeon said, \"To be perfectly frank, I didn't glean very much - she was at pains to tell me she wanted to sit down with other parties and listen to other ideas. But I got the very strong sense she does not have a clear idea herself of what the next steps are, and it doesn't seem to me as if she is prepared to abandon or move any of her red lines to open space for new approaches to be brought forward.\"\nSturgeon added, \"It sounded like what she wanted to do was find a minor variation of her current deal - the one that was so overwhelmingly rejected last night.\"\nwilliam.booth@washpost.com\nkarla.adam@washpost.com"}, {"id": "181", "title": "May's Brexit may yet win out", "publisher": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/theresa-mays-brexit-plan-isnt-dead-yet/2019/01/16/17fc6a00-19cd-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html", "time_stamp": "2019:1:17 00:00:00", "content": "LONDON\nThe poet Rupert Brooke voiced the exhilaration of those Britons who welcomed the war in 1914 as a chance to escape monotonous normality, \"as swimmers into cleanness leaping.\" They got four years mired in Flanders's mud. In a 2016 referendum, Britons voted, 52 percent to 48 percent, for the exhilaration of emancipation from the European Union's gray bureaucratic conformities. They thereby leaped into a quagmire of negotiations with an E.U. determined to make separation sufficiently painful to discourage other nations from considering it.\nOn Tuesday, Parliament emphatically rejected the terms of separation that Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the E.U. So, there is no majority, in Parliament or the country, for anything other than, perhaps, a second referendum, which might be impossible to organize before the March 29 deadline for leaving the E.U. - although the E.U. might extend the deadline, hoping for a British reversal. Another democracy recently rethought something momentous. On Sept. 29, 2008, with the U.S. financial system nearing collapse, the House of Representatives voted 228 to 205 against the George W. Bush administration's bailout plan. The Dow promptly plunged 7 percent (777 points off 11,143), and four days later the House reversed itself, 263 to 171.\nBritain's 2016 referendum came hard on the heels of the 2015 surge of asylum seekers into Europe. Much more than the margin of Brexit victory probably was provided by anxiety about Britain's and Europe's social cohesion. Since then, however, the immigration issue has cooled: Those identifying it as \"the most important issue confronting Britain\" plummeted from 48 percent in June 2016 to 17 percent in October 2018 .\nOf the four nations that compose  the United Kingdom, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted Remain, Wales and England voted Leave. Many Remainers disparage many Leavers as \" English nationalists.\" Brexiteers can cite a noble pedigree for their sentiments: Speaking in 1933 to the Royal Society of St. George, Winston Churchill said: \"On this one night in the whole year we are allowed to use a forgotten, almost a forbidden word. We are allowed to mention the name of our own country, to speak of ourselves as 'Englishmen.' \" The E.U. has dangerously promoted the blunderbuss principle that nationalism - the belief that one's nation has uniquely admirable aspects - is always dangerous. This principle stigmatizes normal and often defensible judgments.\nIn 2016, many Brexiteers had an aspiration with a glistening pedigree - Churchill's vision of British greatness ensured by looking not across the English Channel but across the Atlantic to ever-closer relations with what Churchill called \"the Great Republic.\" This prospect lost luster when, 138 days after the referendum, that republic elected Donald Trump, whom many of Charles Darwin's countrymen think evolution passed by.\nDiminishment and loss of control have been recurring British anxieties since the nation emerged depleted from World War II. In the Brexit debate, references to Suez have rekindled painful memories of the 1956 British-French-Israeli invasion intended to reverse Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. The invasion was halted by a furious President Dwight D. Eisenhower using the leverage of Britain's financial weakness. Brexit is an attempt to revive national control and stature. It is subtracting from both. \nBrexiteers believe that the fact that leaving the E.U. has proved to be so difficult a prison break validates Euroskepticism. They ask: Britain, which has been in the E.U. since 1993, was self-governing since the Romans departed in 410, so how calamitous can Brexit be? Very, respond Remainers, with increasing plausibility as the prospect of a \"hard Brexit\" - divorce with no new U.K.-E.U. legal and commercial relationships in place - becomes more probable. \nEconomic globalization, with the increasing importance of just-in-time inventory management of complex supply chains, raises the stakes for Britain, whose trade with the E.U. far exceeds its trade with either the United States or China. Steep tariffs and other controls could snap into place March 29, and the Wall Street Journal reports that officials at the Port of Dover \"estimate that for every two minutes of delay trucks experience before embarking [on cross-Channel ferries], a 17-mile traffic backup will be created on the M20 highway heading to the port.\"\nMay's stolid pursuit of other people's goal - in the referendum she voted Remain - has evoked the criticism that \"stamina is not a strategy.\" Actually, it might be: As the March 29 deadline for leaving the E.U. draws near, her agreement might seem marginally less unpalatable than, and the only alternative to, a hard Brexit, which could be \"into chaos leaping.\""}]}
